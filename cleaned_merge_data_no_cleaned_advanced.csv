12,"we loved staying here. it was clean, comfortable, and in a perfect location! we only stayed for one night, but i anticipate comng back somewhat frequently and plan to stay here. we had to park in a garage on the street behind the hotel, and then just walked everywhere  or rented bikes. it was also very quiet, which was much appreciated.",google map
13,"we had high hopes staying here, however our experience was a full 1 star.
the 1 star is strictly for location.
we spent 3 nights here with our family of 4 for just over $1,200 only to be surprised at checkout there were over $120 more fees and that's not including parking our own car.

the elevator was down 2 out of our 3 nights. the staff was not friendly, nor welcoming. they also did not help us with navigating around the city, no tips, no advice, no help with direction.

the water pressure was awful, actually there wasn’t any water pressure … more like a trickle.",google map

15,"the argunot is a very special hotel in a very touristy area. being so centrally located, as we are tourists as well, was important. but staying in a place that felt elevated and close to everything was awesome!
heavy tourist areas tend to be over loved a bit kept up. the argunot is an absolute exception! their bedding, specifically their pillows, are fire!",google map
16,"first time in san francisco and this hotel did not disappoint.  great location, friendly staff, delicious food.  will definitely be staying here again.",google map
17,"when we first entered our room, we immediately noticed blood on the outside of the toilet bowl. we called for housekeeping, but no one showed up. after calling again, they sent an engineer - despite me clearly stating there was blood that needed to be cleaned, not a plumbing issue. the engineer left to find a cleaner, and when that person finally arrived, they didn't even clean the bloody area.
my wife is a registered nurse, and seeing unidentified blood in what should be a clean, sterile environment was deeply upsetting. she understands the serious risks of bloodborne pathogens like hiv, hepatitis b, and hepatitis c, and was honestly disturbed that proper sanitation protocols were not folowed. she made it very clear that under osha and health safety standards, this kind of contamination is unacceptable and potentially hazardous. we ended up using the lobby restroom instead of the one in our room. on our way out to dinner, we spoke in person to the front desk, explained exactly what happened, and were assured the issue would be resolved before our return. but when we got back hours later, the blood was still there. this experience  left us feeling extremely  uncomfortable and ignored. for a hotel of this standard, this was a major failure in both cleanliness and responsiveness.
update: the hotel publicly replied, stating they've already ""reached out to me directly"" to address my concerns , but no one has contacted me. i have not received a phone call, email, or message from management. this adds to my frustration, as it feels like they are more focused on
appearances than genuinely addressing guest experiences.",google map
18,"the room was great, spacious and beautiful.
however we were offered a “$75 upgrade to the bay view, with a $50 credit to their restaurant”. we happily accepted, and at no point did anyone clarify the upgrade was $75/day, and we did not confirm the total price of the upgrade either. we ended up paying 100s of extra dollars that we had not budgeted for.

when checking out we tried to clarify that we were told the upgrade was $75 flat and they said that’s not how their upgrades work and there’s nothing they can do to correct this misleading offer.

we really enjoyed our stay but we felt this “promotion” was quite predatory, so watch out for the offers they make.",google map
19,the location is fantastic and the hotel is lovely. everyone is very friendly and the room was spacious. we would definitely stay again.,google map
20,"loved everything about this place. clean, cozy room with charming nautical decor and mine has a distant view of the bay and golden gate bridge, sunrises and sunsets were beautiful. the location is unbeatable, right in fisherman’s wharf and close to souvenir shops, restaurants, and the powell-hyde cable car stop.

huge thanks to corinne, who greeted every guest with a warm smile, so friendly and welcoming. she truly made the stay even better.

great value for money. highly recommend, and i’d absolutely stay here again solo or with my family!",google map
21,"i was looking to be near fisherman's wharf but a bit removed from the crowds. this was the perfect location for that. ||the only negative was the parking situation. we had planned to leave the car all day upon check out (and fully prepared to pay) but they said our car had to be picked up by 1pm from the valets. i should have researched it ahead of time so i could have made different arrangements because it really made us shift our plan for the day to all of a sudden have our car for our sf sightseeing day.||oh, and the windows desperately need to be cleaned. we had a bay view room and the view was really compromised by the very filthy windows. if paying a premium for the view, i would expect a clean window. the rest of the room and hotel was very well taken care of and clean so the windows were a surprise. probably just caught them on an off day.",google map

28,"location was good, however the bay view rooms were not value for money. the windows were dirty, and weren’t cleaned until after we checked out even though the front desk staff said they would be cleaned the previous day. paid a premium for the bay view but was not worth it. service as well overall was not satisfactory.",google map
29,"everything was ok until the check-out time the 17th of june.
there was a charge for breakfast on my bill that was not mine. the man from reception, brendan was so unkind to me. it was not my falt and he did not even say sorry or ask, he just looked at me and printed the new bill. as i did not understand well the charges because the language, i asked for more information and he started to make faces, to huff and look at his peer as i was stupit, making me feeling so bad.",google map
30,"charming hotel in fisherman’s wharf – a comfortable stay

this was my second time staying at this hotel in the past 10 years, and it still has its charm. the location in fisherman’s wharf is perfect,convenient and scenic. the reception staff were relatively friendly, though they seemed a bit overwhelmed at times.

the room was spacious and featured a very comfortable king-size bed, which made for a great night’s sleep. while the bathroom felt quite dated and the shower pressure was underwhelming, everything was clean and well-maintained.

overall, i was happy with my stay and would consider returning again.",google map
31,"this hotel has elegantly whimsical nautical styling, including various staff uniforms (!) all employees were welcoming and helpful, the blue mermaid restaurant had wonderful food and excellent service. we never had to wait to be seated and were pleased with every dish we tried.  the hotel location at the end of the fisherman's wharf area was ideal for our long weekend of experiencing some of the highlights of san francisco.

34,"this hotel ended up being better than i thought. if you're a super light sleeper like i am, you may have issues unless you get a ""courtyard"" room (just inner walls & a couple plants.) my room was on the street but on the very backside of the hotel. day time was still noisy but night was quiet enough. beds/ pillows sup comfy. inside dark/ no natural light but nice & clean. only had drinks at the restaurant & they were so bad we sent them back. didn't try the food. this was disappointing. all employees were nice & helpful. but our stay was tainted by a bunch of sneaky & undisclosed extra fees. they advertise valet parking as $75/ night (you have no other choice if you have a vehicle.) but when you checkout they charge you a ""tax"" on the valet so it ends up being $85/ night. just be upfront & honest & say it's $85. then all the other taxes/ fees also, which isn't necessarily the fault of the hotel. however they double charged us for parking. when we tried to call & discuss both the front desk guy & front desk manager tried to tell us the bill was correct & to just accept it. it was only after we didn't let up that they acknowledged & corrected the mistake. but even the correction they didn't fully refund us. whether that was an honest accident or another sneaky attempt to extort more money, i'm not sure. they did eventually fix that as well but it required yet another phone call on our end. this truly soured the whole experience which was otherwise wonderful and pleasant.",google map

37,"my wife and i stayed in the argonaut for four nights in may. we were very inpressed with the location, the hotel staff were exceptional including the restaurant staff. our room was lovely and the star shaped pillow on the bed was a great touch. the food for breakfast and the evening meal were exceptional and we loved the way the restaurant was decorated. we were sad to leave the argonaut and as a momento wanted to take one of the star pillows home with us. sadly we could not fit one in our luggage but since returning home to the uk i have contacted the hotel to ask about getting a pillow sent back to the uk. aaron from the housekeeping team was extremely helpful and our pillow turned up and looks great on out own bed as a constant reminder of our stay. i would not hesitate to recommended the argonaut hotel and will be looking to return as soon as we can to stay.",google map

54,"we recently stayed at the argonaut hotel in san francisco and had a fantastic experience! situated in the heart of fisherman’s wharf, the argonaut is just steps away from the cable car turntable and ghirardelli square and a few blocks down from pier 39.  while the area is bustling with tourists, it offers convenient access to many attractions and transportation. from the moment we entered, the inviting atmosphere and helpful staff made us feel welcome. the hotel's nautical theme, with its exposed brick walls, wooden beams and maritime decor, adds a charming touch. ||we stayed in a city view king room overlooking the cable car turntable. despite some nearby construction, the view was still enjoyable and is sure to improve once the work is completed. the room was spacious, clean, and the bed was comfortable. there were a few dust bunnies along the wooden beams, but nothing that detracted from our stay.|the blue mermaid restaurant. |the french toast was exceptional! we’re from south louisiana  and know a thing or two about donuts and french toast and my son said it was the best he’s ever had. chef’s kiss! it was so good, it would be worth it to just stop in for breakfast even if you didn’t choose to stay at the hotel. | staying in fisherman’s wharf is undoubtedly touristy, but it was exactly where we wanted to be. the argonaut hotel's prime location, comfortable accommodations, and attentive staff made our trip memorable. thank you for having us! we would gladly stay here again on our next visit to san francisco.",google map
55,"good bits: the location, the view from our room of the bay and alcatraz, the complimentary bottled water at reception. |bad bits: not good value for money - our suite was very expensive and the rest of the hotel did not live up to expectations. service was non existent - we took our own bags to our room (no assistance was offered), every time we tried to call guest services we got an ai bot that was utterly useless and infuriating. the restaurant was average with surly service and very expensive. our one and only experience with the concierge on our first morning was so poor we relied on google from there on in - she ignored the questions we asked and tried to upsell us on things we weren’t interested in. the one piece of info we did get out of her turned out to be incorrect. |the hotel is in a beautiful old building but alas feels soulless in the communal areas and there is no sense of a ‘hub’. staff weren’t rude but neither were they friendly. there was little proactivity - there was a lot of chatting amongst themselves while guests stood around waiting for attention. |overall our stay was not terrible, but neither was it great and for the money we spent it wasn’t good value so we could not recommend it. |we were not asked about our stay at checkout. |i was send a satisfaction questionnaire after leaving which i filled out honestly but the hotel has not followed up about any of our feedback. |it just felt like they didn’t care very much. |a real shame.",google map

however we had what sounded like a party next door to us through paper thin walls we could hear everything. we eventually called down at 1am to ask if they could call up next door to tell them to quiet down however they didn’t ask what side, said they will do and the ‘party’ continued until gone 3am. following that evening our ac unit rattled ridiculously loud we had to turn it off but it continued making a whirling noise for several hours as well as the fridge and pipes in the bathroom whenever next door flushed the toilet. you can just hear everything next door and above.
we have also been to plenty of hotels on our trip where they have made us aware of the holding charge and how much, but here the person at the desk was very transactional and did not warn us about the $300+ holding charge… my husband and i are concerned for being charged so much without even communicating it (hoping we receive this back promptly)",google map

(the only reason we stayed here on this night).  check out was not as nice as check-in, it was more here ya go get out.
received printed copy of room bill and we left.  two days later receive an email with a new invoice stating we are being charged for eating a bag of cheeze-it's and tates cookies.  we did not! first diabetic people can't or at least shouldn't eat that junk and second i suspect they are trying to just up-charge us thinking we are tourist or the maid stole them.  but it definitely wasn't us.   this hotel is off our list.  beware of your bill people check it well.

all the staff i encountered were friendly, professional and courteous. a special mention goes to brendan and matt, who were both incredibly helpful and genuinely went above and beyond to assist. they made a great impression and added a personal touch to the stay.

the room was spacious, with plenty of storage, a comfortable bed and a nice modern shower with good amenities. it was clean, well kept and ideal for relaxing after a day out in the city.

i had breakfast at the blue mermaid, which is attached to the hotel. the free option included one pastry and one drink, which felt a little stingy. i upgraded to a cooked breakfast. it was ok overall, though probably a bit pricey for the quality. i only ate there in the morning so can’t comment on the rest of the menu.

89,"we had a fantastic stay at the argonaut. the rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable. the hotel is perfectly located for visiting fisherman’s wharf and the local area, with the vintage tram starting just around the corner. both ladies on the concierge desk were amazing and helpful. i organised an in room massage which was just what i needed. and dad got tips on the perfect place for an evening glass of wine.
i would highly recommend the argonaut hotel to anyone staying in san francisco",google map

the beds were very comfortable, reception staff very helpful although understaffed on one occasion so i gave up waiting.
internet was unusable, the hotel tried hard and got me connected but as soon as i went back to my room the speed was so slow we could not use it. we had four devices all experienced the same problem, even when they gave us another network to try. by reception it did work much better but no good within the room. service connected but no bandwidth capacity.
qr code for room service did not work, displayed table not found message. tried to call, no answer. after going to reception i was told it was closed already, i think it was soon after 9pm. i thought the whole point of room service was to get food late at night, obviously not here. luckily there is an in & out just up the road.
the room fridge had nothing in it, not sure why they take a $100 per night deposit?
these things may be usual here, but i'm sure many visitors are from other countries, the price was high and i expected more, so i won't be staying here again.",google map

they were booked solid, and things looked hopeless.  they put in a ton of extra work to move reservations around, and make things happen for me.  they were booked solid anyway.  so, they could have just told me i was screwed.  that would have been th easy route.

113,"this was our third time coming to this site because of its location near the wharf and our experiences from the past.   we actually like this location because it forces us to walk around to see everything that the wharf area has to offer and it’s a way to burn off food as you have to walk back to the hotel.
this was our first time bringing our 7 year old daughter as we wanted to share the experience with her.  the staff were nothing short of amazing and went above and beyond to make her feel welcomed.  we had a two queen bed room facing the bay.  this time we got the alcatraz view and it was great to see my daughter enjoy that view of the bay.   the rooms we get are always clean and fully stocked with what we need….sound proof too.
the best part of this trip and i know this is a small little hype but my wife forgot her earplugs and sleep mask.  the hotel apparently had a bunch of them in stock for guests like my wife.
the restaurant attached was always delicious and we normally utilize it as our breakfast spot before hitting the town.",google map

115,"the argonaut hotel is in san francisco's fisherman's wharf. as someone who lives nearby, i have not stayed there, but i've heard many positive comments from friends who have. this review looks at the hotel’s history rather than its services.

the hotel is located in the historic haslett warehouse. this warehouse was built between 1907 and 1909 by the california fruit canners association, which later became known as del monte. at one time, it was part of the world's largest fruit and vegetable cannery. architect william mooser designed the building, which features red brick walls and douglas fir beams, reflecting the industrial style of its time.

canning stopped in 1939, and the building was used for various purposes until the national park service took it over in 1978. in 2001, plans were made to turn the warehouse into a boutique hotel. however, in march 2002, a five-alarm fire caused significant damage and delayed the project. i remember that night well. aaron peskin was the district 3 supervisor at the time, representing the fisherman's wharf area. he played a key role in saving the old historic walls from demolition. despite the fire setback, restoration continued, and the argonaut hotel opened in august 2003.

today, the argonaut hotel has 252 rooms decorated in a nautical theme to celebrate the building's maritime history. the ground floor also includes the san francisco maritime national historical park's visitor center, which offers guests insights into the area's rich seafaring heritage.",google map
116,"spacious rooms with first-class box spring beds – we slept very well. the solid brick walls give a high-quality, quiet feeling. however, at check-in (12:00), we specifically asked for a quiet room, and the receptionist assured us we’d get one. but when we arrived later, we were given a noisy room by the street and next to a loud ventilation system. thankfully, we could switch to a great room on the 4th floor.

another issue: we were told we’d get a $15 credit for the restaurant, but it was only mentioned verbally. the next evening we ate there and paid by card – only afterward did we remember the credit. reception then said nothing could be done. a simple voucher would’ve avoided this frustration.

overall, still a very good hotel – just a few things to improve.",google map
117,"albergo nella zona più bella di san francisco, fisherman's wharf, comodissimo per raggiungere a piedi l'imbarco per alcatraz e il molo 39 ricco di negozi e ristoranti. camere spaziose, in stile marinaro. personale cortese e disponibile.",google map

119,"if you want to be close to fisherman‘s wharf and pier 39, this is a great hotel to stay in while in san francisco. only a few minutes walk to ghirardelli square, across the street from the california line trolley.  can’t say enough about the location. the hotel was clean and well kept. the staff were friendly, courteous, and helpful. more of a boutique hotel atmosphere.  would recommend upgrading to a bay view room.",google map

121,"i will only stay here when i come to sf for work. and also - 100%, most definitely haunted. 😂

the hotel: i was so impressed by the staff here. most all of the staff called me by name, asked me how my day was, delivered my luggage and packages to my room. they were always in a good mood and it was overall just a breath of fresh air. comfy beds, amazing food, and just a super cozy spot in a safe part of the city.

the ghost story: i was staying in room 4024 (i think!) - and at around 4:00 in the morning, something woke me up. i'm still not sure what. i am partially deaf, so i normally sleep through the night. i looked down the hallway in my room and the bathroom light was turned on. i knew that the light was set to be motion activated. i sat there for a while and waited for it to turn off, which it did. and about 30 seconds later, it turned back on, and i heard things moving around on the counter in the bathroom. it sounded like my makeup powder jar being shifted and picked up a few times. this lasted about 60 seconds. i eventually got up to look, but there was nothing there, and it was too hard to tell what if anything had been moved. needless to say it took me an hour to fall back asleep. 😂 - i didn't feel super scared at all, it was just an experience that was unexplainable. i did try to explain it. i even looked up any seismic activity that could have caused it to give an explanation and there was nothing on that date / time reported. i tested how sensitive the motion light was and i had to fully walk in the bathroom for it to turn on, it wasn't sensitive at all. if it was only the light, ok - it could be electrical. but the fact that it happened twice, and i heard what sounded like someone in the bathroom moving my things around? 👀

i asked the front desk about it and they kindly turned the motion setting off for me for the final night haha. overall - love this spot, it felt like a home away from home and the spooky element added a fun paranormal experience & reminder of the history behind the location.",google map
122,"when booking over the phone, we were told we would have a double queen with ""two large windows looking out at the golden gate bridge and alcatraz"". upon arrival, we had one window with a bridge view only. felt like a bait and switch. otherwise, fine hotel. just be careful what you are told if booking over the phone!",google map

140,having been a loyal customer for many years including over 20 nights in 2024 and 3nights last week - we arrived on the last leg of our us holiday to be told there was a “maintenance” problem and we were shipped off to a local hotel. after travelling all day this was incredibly frustrating and disappointing- particularly as they sell themselves as a hotel that respects loyalty- there was a conference on and they obviously oversold and loyalty went out the window when there was a buck to be made. ironically i have also recommended this hotel to many travelers to sf - which makes the experience even more frustrating,google map
141,"location is ideal on the waterfront, next to the hyde park cable car depot, and the bv cafe.",google map

we suddenly needed to cancel a full 2 months in advance. they wouldn't work with us at all. they will keep everything, ""it's just non-refundable"" over and over. would only let us change dates with a few days. when you want to stay around home for a close family memeber with stage 4 cancer, it's tough luck.

i travel to sf a couple times a year, and i will never even consider them again.

i am sure the rooms are nice, but unfortunately, this is my one and only experience with them.",google map

166,"let me start by saying that i would give a 5 star review of this hotel, however with the obsessive amount of noise that will prevent you from relaxing and getting rest, which is the main thing one would be looking for when booking a hotel, then i cannot honestly give 5 stars. whether it was noise traveling through the walls from neighboring rooms or stomping from rooms above, you won’t be able to get passed the loud noises. then top it off with the street noise right outside the rooms on the street below. our last night here, there was a gathering of low rider vehicles who had their sound systems up so loud, all you could hear is the base rattling the walls of the room. not much that the hotel could do about it, but they knew that this took place on a regular basis when the weather is good outside. sure wish they would’ve have mentioned this when booking! nonetheless, if extreme noises are your thing, stay here. if you’re liking to get rest and be able to relax, beware. it’s an expensive nights stay to not be able to enjoy your stay.",google map

as a warning, be very sure that you know if you really want breakfast for your bookings, otherwise, pick the valet package.

170,"i recently  had the pleasure of staying at the argonaut hotel in san francisco, and i must say, it was a memorable experience that deserves recognition. from the moment i checked in, i was impressed by the cleanliness and comfort of the room. it was spotless, well-appointed, and remarkably quiet—a perfect retreat after a day exploring the city. i also want to commend the hotel for maintaining such a fresh and odor-free environment, even though it is pet-friendly. it made me wish i had brought my dog instead of leaving her at a boarding facility!

one highlight of my stay was the excellent customer service. during checkout, i noticed unexpected charges on my final bill. after reaching out to the team, angel palacios, the front desk supervisor, responded swiftly and professionally. they identified the error, issued a refund for the charges, and even went above and beyond by waiving the daily guest amenity fees as a gesture of goodwill. this level of attentiveness and care turned a potential inconvenience into a positive experience.

additionally, i want to give special kudos to the blue mermaid restaurant. i forgot to bring dining utensils, but their staff kindly provided us with plates and silverware without hesitation. it’s these thoughtful touches that truly elevate a guest’s stay.

if there’s one small improvement i’d suggest, it would be offering complimentary refreshments in the lobby or waiting area. however, i understand that health codes may pose a challenge. i’d also love to see bidets added to the bathrooms—an amenity that would add extra comfort and convenience for guests.

the argonaut hotel has left a lasting impression with its outstanding service, attention to detail, and guest-centric approach. i highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting san francisco—it’s a gem that combines charm, comfort, and top-notch hospitality.",google map

194,"terrible hotel whose sole goal is to extract as much money from their guests as possible while providing subpar services.

i came expecting more because of the good reviews, but ultimately, it's a big disappointment.

the hotel is dated, and not super well cleaned. the shampoo/conditioner is the lowest quality you can get (basically what you'd expect from a motel six). for the price and the crazy high resort fee ($75), you'd certainly expect more.

they charge $5 for a small bottle of water, and fill the room with candy that they can't wait to gouge you on. they have coffee, but don't have any tea bags to offer (come on! they're really not that expensive, do you really have to cheap out here when you charge so much already?)

they also don't have a microwave. and when asked about it, the receptionist gave some ""oh it's cause of the fire code"" answer. the real answer is that they want to force you into the extremely overpriced hotel restaurant on-site.

all-in-all, it's a hotel designed to extract every penny from rich older people while delivering subpar value. i'd stay away from this one.",google map

the location is also fantastic. just a short walk to the left brings you to a beautiful beach with views of the golden gate bridge and ghirardelli square. head right, and you’ll find the kids’ favorite, in-n-out, as well as fisherman’s wharf; walk a little further, and you’re at pier 39. highly recommend this hotel!",google map

the hotel did provide a $100 voucher for the blue mermaid bar, which is mediocre in food and drink. the staff were helpful enough. i would have rather been sleeping though.

when i did get to my room, the thin walls meant that i was woken up by the room next door - at least someone was enjoying themselves.

the room was spacious and beautifully-appointed in a nautical theme. sliding wood doors separate the bedroom from the living area and from the bathroom, which had a deep massage tub and a standalone shower. a door separates the main bathroom area from the toilet, which further enhances privacy.

there are two large flat-screen tvs and a formal dining room table and chairs. a hideaway bed couch and two large chairs occupy the living space, along with two smaller tables. the room also has a mini-fridge that contains beverages for purchase if one is so inclined. a small safe sits in the coat closet in the main space, while the bedroom also contains another closet.

housekeeping service provided by eva was exceptional, and i want to also single out josh, karina, and brian at the blue mermaid for providing service that was above and beyond. the front desk staff was also friendly and helpful.

the location at the end of fisherman’s wharf near ghirardelli square and across from the national maritime historical park was optimal. we had stayed near union square and/or market street and nob hill on previous visits but we found this location to be the best and most convenient overall.",google map

after seeing mr. tony roumph's response, i actually asked to meet with him (since we were still at the hotel when i had posted the review), especially since his response was so professional, and not at all argumentative. he introduced me to the chef, mr. amod singh. mr. singh was personable and friendly and so willing to create a vegetarian indian meal for us for that evening.

we enjoyed an amazing dinner of dal, rice, and sabji (vegetable) along with a delicious appetizer, pakoras, and finger-licking-good dessert, kheer.

also, regarding the shower, mr. roumph immediately sent a maintenance person to our room to fix the shower handle thing - and it worked perfectly the next morning.

will i go back to the argonaut? yes!!

thank you to mr. roumph and mr. singh for making our trip even more pleasurable.

rooms are ok, a bit smaller than expected. the bathroom is old and needs upgrading, but the shower has good water force. the bathroom is very, very small, one sink, barely any room to put toiletries.

and i miss the amenity kits offered by hotels in the past. these days, it's all about large bottles, locked down, and nothing else - no shower cap or those fragrant hand soaps that i absolutely love. at least 4+ star hotels should bring those back.

the drinks served at the restaurant were fantastic....the breakfast, not so much. what's up with such few vegetarian choices?  we thought about having dinner at their blue mermaid restaurant but found scarce vegetarian options, surprising since it's sfo, and even more given their chef is indian, a mr. amod singh.

the rooms and hotel facilities are nice, but we did notice that they could benefit from more thorough cleaning. there was a noticeable amount of dust, which detracted from the overall comfort.

additionally, we had an issue with the air extractor (or aov system) in our room—it was quite noisy. the management did offer an apology and a small reduction on the taxes, which was appreciated given that we only stayed for two nights.

361,the view from our hotel in san francisco. we booked the room especially for a bay view. the best hotel for those types of views is argonaut hotel right on the parks edge.,reddit
362,the argonaut seems closer to more “touristy” things and looks like i can get a golden gate bridge view room.,reddit
363,"and the argonaut is a nice hotel, though the clientele can sometimes skew toward midwestern tourist families. my advice is stay at the argonaut and consider doing a brunch at the garden court.",reddit
364,"the palace is not a bad place, but it's mainly there for history. if you prefer modern amenities, take the argonaut hotel. it is the best",reddit
365,"compare to luma hotel, riu plaza, harbor court hotel ,argonaut hotel is probably going to be the most centrally located hotel based on the fact that you’ll be doing touristy things and transportation.",reddit
366,would highly recommend the argonaut hotel. one of my favorite places to stay and is right where a lot of the sights are. also connected to the historic trolley and cable cars to get around if you won’t have a car. close enough to touristy area without being in it directly. you can get anywhere quickly from where this hotel is and it’s beautiful as well.,reddit
367,my parents actually still stay there every time they go to san francisco because they love the quietness. the hotel is also dog friendly and they like to travel with their dogs. i wouldn't say the bar/food/drink options in that area are great. there are definitely homeless people who sleep in doorways and alcoves around there but i don't consider that sketchy.,reddit
368,i’d very strongly recommend the hotels around fisherman’s wharf over those in union square. check out the kimpton alton and the argonaut. both are very nice and reasonably priced,reddit
369,"the argonaut would be a better option if you do want to be in a more bustling location where lots of activities are quickly walkable. but yes, it will definitely be louder since it’s right in a busy area of fisherman’s wharf.",reddit
370,i believe hotel argonaut is lovely and right next to ghirardelli square.,reddit
371,you should check hotels near fisherman’s wharf area like argonaut hotel. the prices are surprisingly on the lower end and in the heart of everything that you and your girl friend will want to see. everything is accessible from there. we stayed at the argonaut a few weeks ago and it was awesome.,reddit
372,"the argonaut hotel is very nice but likely above your expectef budget right now. you could choose hyatt regency, marriott union square or marriott marquis will be good home bases.",reddit

402,"my family and i went to san francisco for the 4th of july weekend and it was quite hectic to get there. upon arrival at the argonaut hotel, everything changed for us. luis immediately greeted us with a big smile and made the check-in process so smooth and he even escorted us to our room and established that we had everything we needed before he left. he gave us some great recommendations for food and drinks before he left also. throughout our stay, anytime luis saw us in the lobby, he greeted us by name and made sure our stay was comfortable. his professionalism and courteousness was unlike anything i've experienced locally. this was our first time at argonaut hotel, but it definitely won't be our last because of the experience luis gave us. thanks so much for making an otherwise stressful holiday weekend a better and more joyful experience!",yelp
403,"location was perfect. hotel is by the beach, close to the cable car stop, and walking distance to pier 39 and the ferris wheel, and a variety of food stalls and restaurants. valet parking available for a fee, which was worth it! all the employees we met, from the front door to the front desk were helpful and friendly! they even gave my kid a toy when we checked in. rooms were clean.",yelp
404,"great location for a tourist visit, convenient and scenic. outstanding service. spacious and comfortable rooms. the destination fee includes a dining credit and i was hoping to use it one night, but the bar closes frustratingly early! i love reuse of a historic building, and all the furniture & decor fit in well. having the lobby shared with a national park visitor center underlines that history. surprisingly given that fact, the walls between rooms were quite thin, i could hear a normal-volume phone call by my neighbor, and my colleagues on other floors reported similar.",yelp
405,"great atmosphere, nice well maintained historic building. clean ( except the new carpet and little trimmings and the edges weren't done. ). great bed and the accessible shower was done correctly ( not common in hotels). the bar is small and i hope you like common drinks ( not well stocked). the breakfast bakery items and fruit plates were wonderful. the bar (restaurant) staff is very nice and accommodating. the front desk is polite. the concierge is often not there and when they are they do not have a lot of fun answers. overall i would return, and do my homework on what is in walking range.",yelp
406,i paid additional money for an upgraded city view room. it's such a joke that it actually feels like i was taken advantage of.,yelp
407,"i dine at the blue mermaid frequently with my family. i'm a long time local of san francisco. last night i was taking a walk from pac heights to the area and needed a bathroom. i figured i would pop into the argonaut hotel since i'm always there for food. the puny little fella behind the counter was rude and inconsiderate and said that i needed to be a hotel guest to use the bathroom when i was already in the lobby and our friend kylie was in room 407. can you believe to my surprise that he would not let me use the lobby restroom?! i've just never heard of such rude customer service or behavior from anyone. the security guard was nicer since he was about to offer it to me until the guy behind the front desk intruded in our conversation and refused the door code. shame on you for refusing a lady a common courtesy task of allowing someone to use your facilities. honestly, i'm still aghast at your thoughtlessness. someone needs to fire him. he has glasses and a hat. he's just a heartless human, sad to say. what has this city become where you can't be kind to locals anymore?",yelp
408,great hotel. the food was good location is amazing and the staff was very helpful. close to a lot of different places and the trolly car is right outside. i even took a sightseeing tour bus and it was outside the hotel as the meet up area.,yelp
409,"the room was very comfortable, clean, and well appointed. we had an ocean view on the wharf side and still found it to be surprisingly quiet. the restaurant and bar are the standouts here with really exceptional food and drink. we loved it.",yelp
410,"beautiful hotel, excellent location, friendly and helpful staff, large clean room and great food from the mermaid. we will be back!",yelp
411,"great hotel and location on the fisherman's wharf. only issue was the local musician who played music off his car speaker every night til 10 pm on the wharf side. rooms are clean and nice, staff is professional and helpful.",yelp
412,"yeah, hotel was very spectacular. i had had a great day with a reusing, indulging and still kept water in touch overall was very nice with the baby being very and very comforting but if you am bringing a child, make sure you keep them out of the snack bar or the adopt a seal because they will charge you $10-$20 i however, loved the free amenities. i would recommend staying because it is very close to pier 39 and it is right beside the ocean. also connecting to the restaurant overall was very nice and that's why will be giving us a four star.",yelp
413,"location is very good and convenient to many fun things with in walking distance. however, the room with an exterior view is extremely noisy with amplified street music and car traffic. make sure to have earplugs! beware that the pull-out bed in the suite is not usable, that is, unless you can tolerate sleeping directly on the mattress springs. would not recommend due to extreme exterior noice and uncomfortable beds.",yelp
414,"unfortunately, our stay at the argonaut hotel wasn't very pleasant. my husband, our two-year-old daughter, and i got so many bug bites from our one-night stay, which cost a total of $450. we felt that the stay wasn't worth the price. the only reason we chose this hotel was its close proximity to the marathon--it was just a few minutes' walk. however, i feel awful that my daughter is scratching constantly because of these bug bites. i'm not sure if it's flea bites or bedbugs . and yes, we're 100% sure the bites came from the hotel. we had family who did all the same activities as us but didn't stay at the hotel, and they didn't get any bites.",yelp
416,"we stayed here recently for a two-night stay. it is a great location, we were able to walk to much of what we had on our list. and when we needed to book a lyft, it was very easy to get picked up/dropped off. the room, while small, was so cute and quaint, with the brick, star pillows, and nautical theme. and best of all, it was so quiet! i booked a courtyard room and did not hear anything. if you've been in that area, you know there are a ton of tourists, music, etc. so the fact that it was dead silent was amazing. no view, but we don't spend time looking out the windows when we're on vacation so it was worth it lol. service was very nice both on the hotel and blue mermaid next door. we had a deal for a free continental breakfast and the second morning they had run out of pastries. so the server subbed in toast (which we preferred anyway) for free. next time we are in san francisco, will absolutely stay here again! just one suggestion for the front desk staff (who were all very friendly and nice) -- it would be great if they could note the amenities like free bottled water and the $15 credit for the blue mermaid. you have to scan a qr code to see the amenities which guests may or may not do. secondly, there is a lot of stuff in the room. snacks, wine, beverages, stuffed animal for purchase and in various areas of the room. given how small the room is, it was a little annoying to have all that in the way. recommend removing most of it from the desk, and reducing the sheer quantity altogether.",yelp
417,we had an amazing stay at the argonaut hotel. excellent customer service.,yelp
418,"great hotel- location, service, amenities, decor, room, bed. all great! i would definitely stay here again!",yelp
419,"service is excellent, very friendly folks at the door and the desk. beds are lovely and comfortable with great sheets. the room was great to hang out in. total bonus is having a delicious restaurant attached. and a wine bar! i ordered a bottle of wine, walked over to the restaurant and the staff was very helpful. i ordered food-to-go, sat and had a glass of wine while they prepared my food. extra bonus: the 6-year old loved her fruit and mac-and-cheese. san francisco is not a large town, but i love the location of this hotel. it's easy to walk the entire city (north beach is very close). but if you want to feel safe, this is a good area.",yelp
420,"room was adequate, if dated. staff engagement was fairly positive, which was a definite plus. however, false advertising, we were charged a $15 guest amenity fee which supposedly included a $15 food/beverage credit, bottled water, and a daily newspaper - none of which we received.",yelp
421,"thanks to angel for an amazing check-in experience. he remembered me being a return guest, even though booking was made in my wife's name. he still recognized our loyalty! we'll be back!",yelp
422,"me and my husband planned to go to a comedy show at cobbs comedy which is about 1/2 mile from argonaut hotel, so this is why we chose this hotel. initially we reserved a king suite but upon arrival management had upgraded up to room #256 which is one of the better suites you can get. and let me tell you it was beautiful! it was very clean and smelled good we had a living room and a bedroom with the king bed and the bathroom had a huge jacuzzi tub and a stand up shower. the toilet had its own room which was nice as i could still get ready while my husband does his thing lol! we loved the hotel and will definitely be staying here every time we come to sf, not to mention it's right on the pier.",yelp
423,the argonaut hotel is a very nice hotel with great customer service. my only criticism is that if your room is close to the air conditioning unit you can hear a loud hum. luckily we were able to switch rooms without a problem. overall the argonaut hotel is a very nice luxury hotel in a great location of the wharf.,yelp
424,"if i could give this place 0 stars i would. they had guests screaming out this windows scaring people. this hotel claims that they do not tolerate guests being disruptive but when they were, they didn't do anything about it. the hotel allows their guest to scare people for no reason and claimed, it's new years, they're allowed to. okay and if it wasn't new years? what would the excuse be? this hotel clearly does not hold their guests to their standards. a hotel like this is not worth staying at. would you like to be disrespected and have an employee say that they can do what they want, it's new years. there is no respect from guests or employees. you have employees defending disruptive guests that scream out into the streets from a side window. a hotel that allows this type of behavior from guests is not worth staying at. all around terrible service and behavior.",yelp
425,"if i could, i'd give this 0 stars. they clearly tolerate their guests acting liken a fool. while walking past this hotel with some friends, a random guest staying in this hotel stuck their head out the window and started screaming at us, and it scared my friend causing her to spill hot chocolate all over our belongings and our faces. when we looked up we asked why he did that, and explained it wasn't funny because his obnoxiousness led to us ruining our belongings. he made weird noises at us then called security saying we were being loud and obnoxious, but we were all just incredibly upset. a $400 white purse was ruined with irremovable stains + two hoodies that were both over $80. hotel front desk said there was nothing they could do, which only adds to our frustration because we want to be paid back for the stuff ruined. literally none of this was funny. a hotel that can tolerate such behavior from guests is not one to stay at",yelp
426,"stunning hotel and unbelievable customer service. from the front desk, to the wine bar, the bellhop, valet and restaurant, we had the most wonderful experience. it's a long story, but i royally screwed up the reservation for my partner's 60th birthday. the hotel was so gracious about it and gave us incredible accommodations in spite of my mistake. can't recommend enough!",yelp
427,"my husband, dog, and i had a 5-star experience during our 3-night stay at the argonaut hotel a few weeks ago. although the price may be high, it is a true luxury experience. the rooms are exceptional, their attentive staff is top notch, and the location can't be beat. their entire hotel is nautical themed, which fits perfectly with their location near the water. the lobby was extravagant with a beautiful fireplace and a lot of comfortable seating. there is also an intimate, upscale bar adjacent to the hotel lobby. valet parking is available if you have a vehicle. our room was pleasantly spacious with a large bathroom, an open-space bed and desk area, and extremely comfortable beds. the room was more than suitable for two adults and our pup. upon arrival and checking in, we were greeted by the doorman and valet with excitement, especially when they saw our dog. we were happy that the dog fee was a reasonably-priced, flat rate, compared to other hotels, but when checking in, they pulled out a welcoming gift for our pup. the packaging was impressive, though we weren't expecting much. however, when we got to the room and opened the package we were surprised to find a box fully packed with quality items which included a rope toy in the shape of an anchor, cheetah-print tennis ball, a branded argonaut neck scarf, and a treat, all for our dog. she even made the paws of fame board while we were visiting. as noted above, this location can't be beat. located near ghirardelli square and fisherman's wharf, there are plenty of options for dining and shopping close by. we had a great experience during our time at the argonaut hotel and would stay here again in a heartbeat.",yelp
428,"great hotel! easy check-in, all staff are very friendly.",yelp
429,loved this hotel and location! brendan at registration was superb and so accommodating. and gianni was so helpful with all our luggage. good restaurant too. we had a blast! what a great weekend.,yelp
430,"deceptive pricing! on their website it states free valet parking with stay, but what it doesn't say is that you have to book directly with the hotel. if you use third party site, booking for example. you will not receive that perk and have to pay $65 for parking. steven the hotel staff member was unapologetic and could care less about our concerns i would think twice about reserving a room at this hotel unless you want some surprise costs when checking out. the rooms were clean and comfortable and the hotel location was perfect if your visiting pier 39 and other attractions nearby.",yelp
431,"this hotel is nice, but not so nice that it demands the price they're charging. i had a suite with the bay view, which is essentially their nicest room, and after our long weekend i felt i had overpaid.",yelp
432,great hotel with a very nautical feel. didn't take advantage of many amenities but it was a great stay!,yelp
433,fantastic hotel in a great location! steps away from some of the best restaurants and the famous cable car stop. rooms are cozy and housekeeping comes every day to make the beds and replenish the towels. security on site and super fast valet service.,yelp
434,"stay away from this place, they will overcharge you.",yelp
435,great location and nice enough.,yelp
436,"the argonaut hotel is not only the perfect location, it is adorable! it's just steps away from the aquatic park, the buena vista, ghirardelli square, cable car hop on location, fisherman's wharf, and pier 39! it appears it has been newly renovated with a nautical theme. bed linens were super comfortable, and so was the bed. although we did not eat any food there, the bar was great. front desk staff was super helpful and accommodating. they gave us bottled waters and helped me adjust our reservation to a parking included package, which saved us some money. if we need to get away and want to stay in san francisco or have out of towners visiting again, we will definitely be going back to the argonaut hotel!",yelp
437,bed was super comfy. pillows were great. the room was ok and there was some machine noise outside that interrupted my sleep. other than that decent experience. location was great. blue mermaid restaurant was just ok.,yelp
438,"lovely hotel in the wharf area. room was clean, quiet and service was excellent! we'll be back!",yelp
439,"i thought this place was a cute hotel, but be careful on personal items being left in the room. people from our group had their passports and laptops stolen. the room was a very tight space with very little walking room between the beds and door. after the missing items i decided to no longer have housekeeping come to clean the room.",yelp
440,"we had a great stay! it's right in all the mix, but you would never know it by being in the hotel. we had a perfect night!",yelp
441,we have stayed at the argonaut multiple times. it is very close to the piers and the various activities in the wharf area. the rooms are generally quiet and the top floor rooms have a good view of alcatraz. the lobby is quiet and a great place to hang-out and people watch. the restaurant has a good bar and the food is also great for brunch / breakfast. the rooms are good sized and the bathrooms are relatively modern. the service by the staff is great. very much our favorite hotel in san francisco.,yelp
442,"from checking in to checking out and storing my luggage here while i grabbed a bite to eat before heading out to the airport, my experience was nothing but great. anything the hotel could do to make the stay a little better, they did. i flew in and came straight to the hotel for a conference for work, so i didn't pick this location myself. typically these situations make me a little nervous because i don't get to vet the location i'm staying in myself. but when i checked in early, steven at the front desk made it easy and was super accommodating. me and the other guests were given water bottles each time we stopped by the desk, and that was so thoughtful. the room itself was clean, modern, and comfortable. it had liquor and snacks inside (for a charge). there was even an umbrella for guests to use during their stay. if they want to take it with them, they can let the front desk know and they would be charged for it when checking out.",yelp
443,"outstanding in every way. great location to see the sights of san francisco. clean, comfortable and the price is a great value.",yelp
444,"staff was very friendly. we noted it was our anniversary in the reservation, and appreciated the extra nice touches they did for us. the suite also had a large jacuzzi tub, which for the amount of walking we did, was great to have.",yelp
445,"incredibly pleased with our stay at the argonaut hotel. the location was right in the heart of fishermans wharf, and could not have been better situated. we reserved a room with bay view and our view of the golden gate bridge, ghirardelli square and the cable cars was priceless! walking distance to some of the best restaurants, right by hyde,st pier, and right near ghirardelli square. cable car roundabout literally just across from the hotel as well. staff was very friendly and helpful, and hotel felt very safe with keys needed to use the elevator and reach your room floor. we would definitely stay here again!",yelp
446,"this hotel isn't very exciting from the outside, but inside was quite nice. i had a rental car, and the valet immediately greeted me when i drove up. the woman at the front desk was kind, answered all of my questions and was very friendly. the room itself was very narrow, but had enough space for one person. two oddities for me - there is a gigantic mirror at the foot of the bed. as someone that's a very light sleeper, having a reflection of myself all night was a bit odd. second, the shower was quite disappointing - i would have expected a hotel like this to have a nicer bathroom. overall though, nothing specific to complain about. the spa services on the website are actually outsourced and occur in your room. this was a first for me, and i booked a massage during my stay. i've never had an in-room massage before so perhaps its not a fair comparison, but for the price i don't think it was worth it despite the massage therapist being quite wonderful. i'd much rather be in a spa, and wouldn't schedule that a second time. i had a room overlooking the bay. this was nice, but i was expecting to be able to enjoy the outside a bit more and that wasn't possible so i personally don't think it was worth the higher room price for the view alone. to touch on the reviews regarding this hotel being haunted - this was corroborated by a bus driver on a tour that i took, but i didn't personally experience anything out of the ordinary! overall this was a nice hotel, in an excellent location, and i would certainly stay here again.",yelp
447,"excellent location close to the park, the piers, cable car stop, ghirardelli. the rooms were nice, comfortable and had a nautical theme. the staff was friendly and helpful. the restaurant in the hotel is pricey with limited options, but there are a number of restaurants within walking distance. great place to stay if you want to be close to the tourist areas in san francisco.",yelp
448,"chose hotel based on reviews and location. we were not disappointed. we were able to walk everywhere and there were incredible views. i loved this hotel, it was super cozy. the staff were all wonderful, cheerful and happy. the room and property were super clean. i loved the aesthetic, with the exposed brick, etc. also, having the blue mermaid restaurant downstairs was super convenient (and the food was really good).",yelp
449,"we stayed two nights at the argonaut and were overall pretty happy. it's on a very busy street right in the heart of the waterfront - go left as you exit and you'll be right at the cable car & ghirardelli square, and go right as you exit and you'll be on fisherman's wharf. check in went smoothly - they offer a number of tiers of room when you book and we got exactly what we paid for, which was a partial view of alcatraz and the bay. it was directly over the front entrance though so street noise permeated during the daytime. at night the area was much quieter. the hotel is not new but has been maintained fairly well. we were happy with the in room amenities. we took advantage of the valet parking and our car was available within 10 minutes of our numerous requests. we didn't sample the in house restaurant but it looked pretty good and certainly smelled good (lobby always had a waft of brunch). the little nps exhibit in the lobby was also a nice touch to walk around. overall can't beat the location if you want a classic sf tourist experience.",yelp
450,"this review has several layers as we hosted an event here, managed a room block for guests, and stayed at this hotel. i will start with the event since that is where our journey begins. we hosted our wedding in december, 2022 at the maritime ballroom at the argonaut. we were planning our wedding for about a year with diem tran. diem is the best event coordinator we have ever worked with. she is extremely friendly, quick to respond to e-mails, and very professional. a big reason we chose this venue is because we felt comfortable with diem. the venue itself takes imagination. when you go on a tour it is an empty brick room. however once the argonaut staff places all the tables put's out the dance floor and up-lights are added the room becomes very charming. there is also the adjacent del monte courtyard available for the cocktail hour and for your guests to mingle during the reception. the catering staff was very professional and the food came out warm and tasting delicious. great service is a theme of this hotel. everyone staying in our room block was extremely happy with the argonaut. the staff was very helpful and nice and even gave our guests welcome gifts that we curated for them. i have stayed at a lot of hotels and have not stayed at one this size where the staff made it feel like i was staying at a friends house. as for the rooms, this is clincher. the views from the hotel rooms are the best in san francisco hands down. our honeymoon suite was a corner suite thatoverlooked ghirardelli square and the golden gate bridge on one side and alcatraz on the other. whether you stay in a basic room or a suite you will be staying in a very nice room for a fair price. i will recommend this hotel to anyone staying in san francisco or anyone in the bay area wanting a staycation.",yelp
451,"my wife and i really enjoyed our stay. the room was quiet, clean and the staff was super. the robes are amazing and i actually ended up purchasing one. close to the wharf which we loved and everything met expectations. plan to stay again soon.",yelp
452,"deysa was very helpful after a bad experience with reservation line. our room was large with great view. i do wish they had shower caps in room, and i prefer little single use toiletries versus the reusable bottles they use. we were excited for thanksgiving dinner. however, my daughter and i both got sick after eating it (very disappointing considering it was $75 each and quite honestly not very flavorful). we always choose this hotel because of great service & location to everything. however, a lot of restaurants directly across from hotel have closed down. i really like this hotel, but the hallway carpet desperately needs to be replaced. it was unsightly, stained & smelled. it's very off putting, especially when you trip at seams that are separated. again, 4 stars because of deysa, but definitely wouldn't eat another holiday meal here.",yelp
453,"we were a group that stayed at this hotel for a work function. initially, the hotel was pretty standard but it was in a good location close to the local sights. the hotel staff was also okay, middle of the road. the reason why i'm giving them one star is because they charged every room minibar fees when none of us used the minibar. when you are travelling for work, you know that your company does not pay for such inflated charges, especially when all meals are planned and prepaid. none of us even knew at the time because we only received the bill under the door that of course didn't include these fees. they never sent us the final bills with these charges. the only way we found out was when we received the credit card statements a month later. i'd understand making an honest mistake for one room, but there were five rooms that were affected by this fraud. this really seems like they make it a regular practice to add minibar fees regardless of it they were actually used. usually we try to stay away from boutique hotels, but thought we'd give this one a shot since they were slightly lower than other. sorry to say we got what we paid for. never going back",yelp
454,"add on charges are ridiculous. beautiful hotel with terrible service. location good, but everything closed after 8 pm.",yelp
455,"dear sweet god, if you call here to do anything with your reservation, be ready to be stuck on hold in their endless cycle of hold.",yelp
456,watch for hidden fees: this hotel will charge you $35 a day for free wifi and call it an amenities fee.,yelp
457,this hotel far exceeded my expectation. huge bright room with one of the most comfortable beds i've ever slept on. quaint view of the trolly turn around and water were an unexpected suprise. the customer service was exceptional with director deysa so helpful in answering all my questions regarding transportation and dining options. truly a boutique hotel experience i look forward to visiting again!,yelp
458,i got a good view of the beach and sunset from my window! it was so beautiful to look at! the bed was very comfortable and the room was very clean. the lobby is well decorated and has a cute theme.,yelp
459,"arrived late to the argonaut while an unhappy customer laid into the the front desk guy about his reservation - mr front desk kept is cool, while the customer grumbled the travel website's name under his breath and carried on with our check-in without needing a breather! very nice. i would highly recommend the argonaut.",yelp
460,"would i stay again? probably not. next time i'm in town i'll find my way to the wharf from accommodations elsewhere. i learned on this trip that the convenience factor is not a fair trade off for luxury accommodations. to each's own, though.",yelp
461,"my husband and i booked the argonaut hoping for a more high-end experience as we are on vacation. when we arrived someone treated us which was very nice. our room was dirty, hair in the sink and tub, stains on the bed skirt and although we did not book a room with a view our window directly faced another room's window - meaning we could not open the blinds for natural light at all without seeing other guests. during our stay the hotel had kids running and yelling in the hallways - which was awful. and probably a one-off but the alarm in the room next to ours went off for about 25 minutes at 5am, we had to call security to shut it off. during our 12 day vacation in california the argonaut was one of 5 4-star hotels we stayed at. it was by far the worst and does not deserve the accolades and the experience does the demand the price point.",yelp
462,"convenient location, friendly staffs. valet parking attendant is very helpful and courteous. rooms are clean, old school but well kept. definitely we'll be back.",yelp
463,awesome hotel great restaurant great staff everyone's amazing they can clean really historic great feel right on the water right near fishermans wharf especially if you're swimming alcatraz,yelp
464,we stayed here over the long weekend and i thought it was fine. i wouldn't come here again but it wasn't horrible.,yelp
465,"horrible bed, coffee, thin walls, sandpaper sheets, $85 for parking! i'm not going to waste more time but $250 for room, $75 online fees plus $30 when you get there plus $85 to park.",yelp
466,"our overall stay was okay. tensin at front desk was amazing! super helpful with booking & at check-in. the location is amazing right in the middle of the wharf & close to practically everything down here. our room was great with a partial view of the golden gate but we did have an issue with our tv's connection & netflix a few nights in a row. the wifi isn't the best as it went out a couple times while i was working so just be aware if you're working remotely! most of the employees were helpful (some more than others). it was frustrating to some degree as i felt i was being treated differently due to my age being younger than many of the other guests staying here. there seems to be some confusion with dining as they advertise room service on their website, open until 9:30pm, but when i called at 9 the resturaunt was already closed. when i tried again in the morning, they said they don't offer in-room dining and that i would just pick up my food to-go instead. i'm not entirely sure if i would stay here again solely because of the service i received but if you're just looking for a good location & nearby place to sleep after sightseeing this is your hotel.",yelp
467,"the staff were all terrific. veronica, corrine and the rest of the staff were very pleasant and helpful. they made our stay perfect. perfect location, good gym and pet friendly. we had dinner at the blue mermaid on-site. mac and cheese with crab, and chowder with crab were both very good. we will definitely stay here again.",yelp
468,"couldn't be happier. our recent 4 night stay at the argonaut hotel exceeded our expectations .the wonderful staff made us feel welcomed from the moment we first entered the hotel. they were very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. the beautiful bay view from our room was amazing. location couldn't have been any better. walking distance to the piers, restaurants, stores and tour locations. it was an amazing experience and will definitely be back.",yelp
469,what a delightful hotel! this is a historic building dating back to the early 1900's. the decor is beautiful and the staff is friendly and eager to help. the hotel is pet friendly and right in the heart of fisherman's wharf.,yelp
470,"unfortunately the walls in the hotel room are paper thin and i could hear my neighbors talking, moving and doing some other physical activity i would prefer not to hear on my solo staycation. i moved hotel rooms so i could have a view of the golden gate bridge versus alcatraz and now i wish i was looking at a former prison than hearing them do the deed. the location is great and i took advantage of the free bike rental. but when i go away on my own for a relaxing staycation i'd prefer to sleep rather than having pillows on top of my head to block out the noise. guess i should've requested to move a second time. sigh.",yelp
471,"first, excellent covid-19 safety measurements followed throughout, which includes care packets. the argonaut is the most fantastic historical landmark hotel on the san francisco fisherman's wharf. previously a cannery. a 102 year old building. you will see, and can feel, the historical integrity throughout. a place to have a beautiful and comfortable stay, with the utmost impeccable service. exit and you are truly a stones throw to fisherman's wharf, ghirardelli square, the buena vista (best irish coffee in town), maritime museum, fort trolley service. also, lovely bay area views, walks and parks. hotel is also walking distance to the world famous scoma's restaurant and boudin sourdough bread factory.",yelp
472,good location but mediocre overall. paper thin walls and nothing really special about the experience. they sell $6 water bottles in room and that's it. it is communal toiletries which makes me really unsure about cleanliness because of covid. blue mermaid food was nothing special. i probably won't be returning to this hotel.,yelp
473,"wonderful staff! room was clean, fresh and the bed was comfortable. we opened the window to listen to the rain. the concierge, angela, was so very kind and helpful. she went out of her way to set up our trip to muir woods. thank you for helping and helping us check off my bucket list.",yelp
474,"such a cute nautical theme hotel! highly recommend! the staff at check in were pleasant and efficient! they have valet parking so you don't have to deal with it in sf! between the comfy beds and pillows, it's the location that we love. near ghirardelli and the pier plus my husband runs the half marathon so it's the best location for his race. the biggest part is check out is at noon. we can enjoy some breakfast and resting after my hubby's race! bonus: gotta love (and take advantage) that wine bar downstairs. daemon at the wine bar is hilarious.",yelp
475,"it's a nice location, but attention to detail badly needed.trash still in room,candy or pills in the corner of the east elevator,left with the impression that breakfast would be deliver to room left tip for that then finely picked it up myself needed to move the outside heater to have some warmth was told that it couldn't be moved due to plumbing connections i could see the propane tank inside. dinner napkins well by this point i am doing the staff's job. final note sunday morning i need coffee go down sit at the bar, i may be invisible since the 2 people who came behind the bar did not say a peep. in the end if your going to lie to your paying guests have enough self respect to tell one that sounds good.",yelp
476,the argonaut hotel is a beautiful brown stone corner building building next to the shops and eateries of the del monte cannery building. luxurious hotel with impeccable hospitality and sincerely helpful staff.,yelp
477,"two stars for the great location and that's about it. we stayed in a suite which looked like it hadn't been renovated in 30 years. size was great at over 900 sq. feet and the corner view was good. the toilet smelled like a hundred years of flatulence. the kind of smell that only a renovation can address. on top of that, the toilet paper, towels, and pillows are of a grade reserved for cheaper motels, not a $1k a night. the bedding was not hygienic, they take a flat sheet and wrap it around the comforter and it smelled like they only wash the sheet and not the comforter, the smell works as a wake up call. there was mold in the bathroom. if you are looking for luxury, this is not the place. staff was adequate, they do their best with what their employer provides them. it is a historic building that has a good location to fisherman's wharf. if you go with the cheaper rooms you get an inside view of a concrete courtyard which is probably their best value in terms of what they can provide; location without frills. if you want a luxury suite in the same price range and location, there is the hotel fairmont in ghirardelli square.",yelp
478,"5 stars for location on the wharf and amazing, friendly staff who go above and beyond. note to hotel manager about 356 - clean your jacuzzi tub jets and fix the water pressure in the shower. we'll be back soon!",yelp
479,"absolutely adorable. pristine clean and terrific walkable location to anything you want/need in sfo. the trolley car turn around is literally across the street so if you can't walk around to what you want to explore, you can ride. they also offer complimentary bikes. we arrived late and tired and the room and reception was perfect. they recommended the in house restaurant which we had not known about, and were so tired we thought well we'll try it. so glad we did. it was excellent. i had the fettuccini alfredo and added grilled chicken. might have been the best chicken i've ever eaten and i've eaten chicken all over the world (except china). daughter had the salmon and some sort of chowder. staff was masked and distanced and very accomodating as well as cheerful, which is especially appreciated in these covid travel times.. and just a 20 minute ride to the airport. i look forward to my return.",yelp
480,walking by you wouldn't think nothing about thus place but once you walk in you're taken back by the beauty. the ambiance is definitely breathtaking. everything is really right there from the winery next door if you're in the mood to come downstairs or just relax in the chairs in their amazing lobby. great customer service and great experience.,yelp
481,"we booked this hotel because i had a surgery in the sf area and we wanted to bring our dog. this hotel went above and beyond to make us comfortable. from giving my dog pets and treats, to helping with luggage, getting me a kettle for tea post-surgery and upgrading us to a fantastic suite ...we were 100% satisfied. we will only stay here from now on. this place is worth the money. the location is also fantastic and so close to literally everything in san francisco. grateful for a stress-free recovery during the 3 days i spent here.",yelp
482,wonderful place. beautiful room and restaurant. kind and caring staff who made me and my daughter feel very special. we will always remember our visit to san francisco because of the argonaut. and oh my gracious--the crab and corn chowder! it was scrumptious!,yelp
483,"if you're visiting san francisco and staying at fisherman's wharf this is definitely the place to stay. it's right near the action and it's very clean, and beautifully decorated. the staff are all delightful to interact with. we were offered to upgrade our room so we got a bay view for a little more each night. the only thing i would advise is that they placed an additional $300 hold because i think they wanted me to spend that at their restaurant ( which was the most expensive mediocre breakfast i've ever had ever $73.00 for eggs and toast and meat). other than that, it's an amazing place to stay! i would stay here again.",yelp
484,we enjoyed our time here. we loved how it was right next to a large park to walk the dog. each room comes with chromecast to easily stream from devices. beds were comfortable. parking was expensive but at least the cars are parked in a secure location.,yelp
485,"such a lovely hotel in a great location! we were blessed with a king suite and honestly, it was amazing! a great jetted tub in our huge bathroom, along with a really comfy king sized bed and a wonderful sitting area. the staff was really nice, especially brandon who helped us to our room with our massive amount of luggage. we were there on the 4th of july and it was so fun to be right next to where the fireworks were. we loved our stay and experience!",yelp
486,"excellent location and very friendly staff. they gave us a free covid protection package at checkin, which is nice. the only minor issues is they don't have their own parking and the nearest parking lot recommended by the door man is full, thus we end up having to find a different parking place (not too far). we will choose valet parking next time instead of self parking to avoid the problem if having to solve the parking lot full problem",yelp
487,"we came here for a staycation and it was great. the rooms were a lot bigger than expected for the location and were pretty comfortable. for this type of hotel, i'd probably expect slightly nicer bathrooms but overall it was good. they are also dog friendly and the dog had a very enjoyable time. the location is great - right by fisherman's warf and ghiradelli square (a bit touristy for me usually but every now and then is nice) and you can easily walk to the water. lots of nice restaurant options around too. the hotel restaurant does have a restaurant with a nice courtyard type area. didn't try the food but did go for cocktails which were good. some stuff could be a bit more efficient (getting stuff brought to the room, bag check, valet etc) but overall had a solid visit and would recommend this hotel if you are visiting san francisco.",yelp
488,"absolutely amazing staff and service, they really saved us from sleeping on the street last night with incredible service. i highly recommend going here above any of the main stream hotels.",yelp
489,this place was terrible. poor service. couldn't check us into our room for several hours after stated 3pm check-in. lobby smells like a dirty cafeteria. there is barely any service staff at all to help with much of anything. awful.,yelp
490,"participated in organizing in two professional events here and both times felt the support staff and amenities were good at a price that was palatable. the views (if you do outside seating in the small plaza) are pleasant and calming, even on a saturday. the ballrooms less so but good enough. the provided bar and barstaff were ok, no complaints from our visiting patrons. i wouldn't be against renting a ballroom here again or opting for an outside seating function here.",yelp
491,"the only issue we have with visiting the argonaut is that we don't visit enough. the staff is simply amazing to work with. we have been booking blocks of rooms with the argonaut for years now for our workshops every year. we have multiple workshops and they are our preferred hotel of choice. it's important to note that our company allows us to decide who we want to work with and my team and i consistently choose argonaut. the accommodations are lovely and consistent. the rooms are very cool and always clean. i know this because i've toured the rooms and i ask the attendees how they felt. no complaints to date, always great feedback. this hotel is a special gem - it was once a cannery and they kept the charm of the history with the theme of their decor. also important are the other areas that can be rented for events. there is this very cool outdoor spot that is just gorgeous and perfect for a small workshop. the indoor space is just as grand. our conference numbers have grown otherwise we would book the space they have. from the front desk to the coordinators for room blocks, everyone is super friendly and helpful. we works specifically with ayu and michelle. these two ladies are the absolute best. i honestly cannot say enough good things about our experience here. it's so great we book our room blocks for the year without a single worry about being trapped in a bad situation. they are one of the very best hotel accommodations in san francisco, and they are right on fisherman's wharf. very close to some great bars, restaurants and entertainment. we will continue to book with their awesome team.",yelp
492,"pretty disappointing stay, particularly because the was almost empty due to fears over the coronavirus. when we arrived we were assigned arguably the worst room in the hotel (second floor interior, dark, view of roofing, etc.) after specifically requesting an upper floor and bay view. my guess is that the room assignment may have been because we were able to secure an excellent rate due to march visit and low occupancy. not sure why our request was completely ignored. television was glitchy, turning off at will, and when we request a late checkout, we were told check out is noon, no exceptions, regardless of occupancy, etc. have stayed at this property in the past and enjoyed it very much as it's location is perfect for exploring the fisherman's wharf area, access to cable cars, ghirardelli square, etc. not this time, particularly at this price point. even with a great deal, we still paid $250.00 per night. we had a choice between the fairmont and the argonaut hotel, both at the same price point at this point in time. we made a mistake. it's not the cool, class hotel we've frequented in the past. very dissatisfied and disappointing.",yelp
493,"it was a nice hotel, checking in was easy, it was my first time to san francisco and i was tired lol sell the bed sounds great, room service food wasn't that great but i guess you can only expect so much from places.",yelp
494,this hotel was in a prime location and close to pier 39 and all the sites to see at fisherman's warf. the hotel was stylish and clean. the staff was very accommodating and we very much enjoyed our stay there. nice nuances and little nautical designer touches that make this hotel above the rest. we highly recommend and would definitely stay there again or refer this hotel to family and friend!,yelp
495,great location and clean hotel. checkin was a bit slow i think because it was late at night and the front desk guy was having to pull double duty with valet tasks.,yelp
496,"very difficult customer service. we had a 2-night reservation which we made directly with the hotel. we were forced to cancel due to unforeseen circumstances. we called them directly and cancelled 4 days in advance. their policy is at least 2 days in advance. they said we would get a refund. never got it. called them 10 days later and they said we would not get a refund. when i tried to talk to them on the phone they were rude and dismissive. they finally refunded after we raised bloody hell. all of this through numerous phone calls, etc etc. impossible to know what was going on. this place has really gone downhill since kimpton hotels sold it to this lower-rated group.",yelp
497,"check in took about 45 minutes and resulted in me getting a room with someone already in it. when i first arrived, the check in line took about 20 minutes for the three people ahead of me. apparently, they are upgrading their system. i don't know why they chose to do this when there was a big conference going on. when i finally got to my room the key wouldn't work. went back down stairs and waited in the line again, another 20 minutes. when i got my new key, i went to the room, opened the door and someone was already in it! i went back down stairs and was told the check in person put in the wrong number. i was finally given a room that worked.",yelp
498,"my husband and i were excited to stay here because of it's beautiful location and photos online. it was expensive ($455) but decided to splurge for one night. for the price we were disappointed with the attention to detail. the hotel itself was beautiful. the doorman was very helpful with tips of where to eat and what to do. the bellman/concierge was also very friendly. my reason for a two star rating is that our room, although on the surface was clean as we looked further, it was not. we found a dirty sock in the closet and the creamer was so old and curdled when poured in my coffee. also, the restrooms in the lobby had two stalls with no toilet paper in them. i didn't take a picture as i was already annoyed with the previous two things. it was not a bad experience, but for the price, this was disappointing. we stayed there 01/22/20.",yelp
499,overpriced for what you get. price of a high end luxury hotel but really bad quality and service all around. they also sneak in extra fees here and there. i'll never come back.,yelp
500,"the hotel is nice and the basic rooms are clean and comfortable but the staff is so unwelcoming. literally every person we encountered, whether it was the front desk or in room dining, made us feel like we were bothering them for asking basic questions. the night audit guy was particularly unhelpful. typically if you can't accommodate a request, you come up with some sort of solution. in his case though, he couldn't have been less interested in what we were saying. i know people have bad days, but come on; if you can't put on a smile and be helpful you may want to reconsider being in hospitality. everyone at the restaurant and the guy at the valet were nice, pleasant and helpful, though. probably will stay somewhere else next staycation.",yelp
501,"the atmosphere is nautical. quality in a minimal style sea charm. love the name, too. the family area downstairs has board games but is very drafty. the decoration was a xmas at sea feel for me. loved the candy the front desk staff shared along with treasures for children from the sea chest (as trader joe's does). two brothers both work the front desk and it's delightful to see the homely style of service. sweet guys! expensive is the nearby restaurant as we only got a spending allowance for breakfast and not a meal. however, staff are nice letting you grab an extra takeaway coffee.",yelp
502,"i absolutely love this hotel. we have stayed here several times while visiting sf, and it will now be our hotel of choice every time we come to the city. the location is beyond perfect. walking distance to fisherman's wharf/pier, ghirardelli square, trolleys, tour boats, and so much more. i love that they are pet friendly; and not just friendly, but they genuinely make you feel like your fur babies are welcome, cherished guests. they put your pet's name on a welcome board, say hello to them, offering them treats, and water. so comforting when you have to travel with your pets. the rooms are beautiful, spacious, and clean. i love the exposed wood beams and brick in the rooms. the beds are comfortable, and the provided toiletries are luxurious.",yelp
503,"as a passerby, this hotel is beautiful. but what makes this hotel amazing is the service. zuri, a young lady who works at the front desk, does not resist assistance to those who are not staying at the hotel-- but rather does everything she can to help. i would stay here, simply because of her! thank you, zuri.",yelp
504,"very nice,clean place to stay. downstairs bar and restaurant, very comfortable with a pleasant staff. one major caveat however; the quoted price is a far cry from the actual cost at checkout. while most of us are accustomed to a few additional charges at departure, these added costs,while probably legal,ethical would be a stretch. there was even a separate ""tax"" on the 75.00/night car park. ask before committing.",yelp
505,"the argonaut hotel in san francisco is a great place to stay when you are in san francisco. not only is it right on the wharf the staff is very helpful, friendly, and all around great. when you come please say hi to the doorman with the great yellow and blue shoes.",yelp

507,"we were evacuees from the kincade fire in santa rosa. we will never forget the care extended to us by everyone at the argonaut hotel. we reserved here because they are pet-friendly and were astonished to learn that they offered a substantially discounted rate to fire evacuees. everything is a bit of a blur right now, but i think we were there for four or five nights. the staff is lovely and extremely responsive to every request we had. my husband has limited mobility. we ate all of our meals either at the hotel restaurant, the blue mermaid, or from room service. the food was delicious, very fresh, and plentiful. the menu has lots of healthy options but also some splurges. the salmon dishes were particularly well-prepared. and my nightly mescal margarita was the best i've had. no skimping on the mescal. our room was clean, comfortable, and very quiet. i read the review that down-graded the hotel for the garage they use charging for all three cars. this is not the hotel's choice. the reviewers beef is with the garage, not the hotel, and i wish they would revise their review to reflect that. we will definitely return here, either as vacationers or evacuees. thanks to everyone at the argonaut. you are much appreciated.",yelp
508,"extremely insensitive staff upon check in. we booked this hotel a few weeks ago for a fun trip, however we were evacuated from our home in santa rosa this morning at 5 am, along with a large portion of sonoma county and our homes are currently under threat of perishing. we have three cars instead of the planned single car. we asked being that we are fire evacuees in a declared state of emergency, if we could be given a discount for parking or some help. we were told they don't have control over parking and could self park around the corner got $47 each. all of our valuables and belongings were stuffed into our cars. the only reason i'm giving 2 stars is because the bellboys outside were the only staff who showed some humanity to our situation and were very helpful unpacking our cars and getting our stuff to the room. the desk was extremely cold and unhelpful. it's quite shocking that given the current situation, the hotel desk really could care less about our predicament.",yelp
509,this has been one of my favorite places for many years until now. having made a reservation almost a month ago my family and i arrived at 11pm to find that the hotel was sold out and the only rooms left were a single queen or a handicapped accessible room with no tub and two queens. pretty sure the hotel gave my room to someone who arrived earlier in the evening. didn't get the room i booked and the snarker gentlemen at the front desk let it be known that my family's comfort and interest in staying here again was not his concern. super bummed. was really looking forward to being here but we won't be coming back. room 220,yelp
510,"the best thing about this place is the location. i loved that it was in the old del monte cannery, cool detail. the lobby had much nicer style and decor than the rooms. the room looked was a disneyland cruise ship, cheesy nautical. our room was large but the use of space was terrible leaving a large useless area in the center of the room. the bathroom was small, the couch awkwardly faced a blank wall and the desk was touching the bed when there was all this unused space. the tv didn't have movie channels, in fact it had fewer channels than most hotels. granted, we were only in our room to basically sleep but this hotel seriously lacked the amenities that one expects with the rates and additional fees argonaut charges. aside from the housekeeping cleaning everything spotless, there's nothing praise worthy for the staff. going in and out of the hotel, we saw the doormen most frequently and there was only one occasion when they acknowledged us. the rest of the times we passed by them while they stood there doing nothing and helping no one. on day 2, we were walking behind a woman who fell in front of them before entering the hotel and they just watched and chuckled. during my stay, this hotel was publicly advertising breakfast for two with the purchase of a room. all we got was a $10 coupon. i inquired with the front desk about the false advertising and they said the coupon can be used for breakfast. there's nothing on the breakfast menu for $5 or even $10, what a bunch of liars.",yelp
511,we just loved this hotel. great service and location and was quiet. the only disappointment was service during breakfast in the restaurant.,yelp
512,once again we had an incredible stay at your hotel! not only are the staff wonderful and accommodating but the overall experience was stellar. the beds are incredibly comfortable and the linens incredibly soft. the interior design is absolutely beautiful i love this hotel. it is one of my favorites in the nation!,yelp
513,our hotel options are a bit limited when traveling with our dog. we decided on the argonaut and i'm so glad we did.,yelp
514,"kinda cheesy and overdone with the jules verne theme. plus, you would think a brick building would have thicker walls. the woman in the room next door just sneezed, and i wouldn't swear to it, but i think i got a spray from it. and what's with staff ringing doorbell but not waiting for an answer before bathing in? it happened twice, and we were there less than 24 hours. change of review. the company they contact with for parking is awful. for $75, our car should not be held hostage.",yelp
515,"not a bad hotel but not a great hotel. but a decent hotel for the price and the location. i didn't want to spend 1k a night at the fairmont nearby so choices in our price comfort range was slim pickings. it seems like the better choice hotels are in the financial district but that's too far from where my daughter lives in sf. yes the king bed rooms are super narrow, yes the walls are a bit thin, yes there's no fan in the bathroom. but it's clean, the front desk and house cleaners are friendly and efficient and the bed is comfortable enough. this hotel definitely does its job and i will return when i have to stay in the area again.",yelp
516,"stayed here for two nights on a weekday. awesome hotel, good people, great location. checking in was cool, matthew checked us in. nice guy and was easy process.",yelp
517,"do not stay here! beyond what all the other reviews say about thin walls, lazy wifi, the staff is horrible. the cleaners stole my jewelry and when i called to talk to a manager they just kept redirecting me to the housekeeping staff who lied to me and kept me on hold forever. there are soooooo many better places to stay in sf that have honest staff working for them.",yelp
518,"great stay at the wharf. rooms with a nautical theme, great food and cozy lobby with a fireplace to relax. front doormen and staff very friendly. concierge matthew was excellent to work with and provided many great recommendations throughout our weekend stay. hotel rooms are quite noisy with screaming kids and slamming doors. bathrooms could use an update and thorough cleaning. location is good with many restaurant options, shopping, bike rentals and the cable car.",yelp
519,"this hotel is horrible. they charged me in full for my reservation and will not let me cancel. when my wife called to change the reservation, the reservations manager hung up on her! this hotel is mismanaged and has unethical business practice. we will be reporting them to the better business bureau. be aware. do not book here if you don't want to be out the money!",yelp
520,"if i could give a zero star i would. booked less than 24 hours ago and realized that the dates of our stay were wrong. called the hotel and they are refusing to refund my credit card for the cost of over $700, even though the charge is so new it is still pending. they even refuse to modify the dates for us. they need to understand that customer service is paramount in the success of a business.",yelp
521,"buyer beware! the accommodations are nice but we booked our room at the same time as our traveling companions via the same method. we paid a premium for a regular room with a view and our friends chose not to. upon arrival, our friends received a free upgrade to a premium room with the same view as ours so they ended up with a nicer room with the same view for about $500 less than our room for a 3 night stay. we were offered no free upgrades or discounts. very uneven and unfair practice! be very cautious!",yelp
522,"wow, so nice from the valet to front steak. our pup was loved and played with by all. such a fun location right in the heart of tourist central. it's been a million years since i've been in san francisco but i felt instantly at home",yelp
523,"""boutique hotel"" sure has become a superfluous title thrown around these days... it's really just a way to jack up the pricing for literally everything, with little support to back it up when there's a problem. i won't spend too much time reiterating what others have said: thin walls, so you hear what's going on around you, the ""prison yard"" esque view of the inside rooms (good one, reviewer), the toilet paper holder beyond reach of the toilet (at least my room did have an extra roll on the back of the toilet), a bed that's rock hard but pillows that are so soft they really can't be called pillows because your head shouldn't be allowed to meld with the mattress when using pillows, etc. upon check-in, the front desk agent gave me a key to the mini bar in case i wanted to refrigerate any of my own stuff. when i got into my room, i noticed it was already unlocked. i flagged this with the desk because i have not consumed anything and will not be paying for it if they try and tell me i have upon checkout. $100/night ""hold"" for incidentals is ludicrous. as if i'm going to run out of here with the $49 umbrella, $26 small bottle of wine, $14 stuffed plush seal, and the $3.25 two ounce bag of cheetos and not pay for any of it. this is why you keep the card on file, you don't preemptively run a charge for each night. my room has a mirror facing the bed. any designer worth their salt should tell you this is bad feng shui, whether you prescribe to that line of thinking or not, it's just bad practice for sleeping arrangements. sex room/dungeon, okay sure, but just sleeping not so much. my biggest gripe comes from a tech standpoint. i'm in town for a conference, thus need reliable wifi to do work. my first day in, i successfully purchase the $14.95/day upgrade to connect up to three devices - and all worked smoothly. by the time i returned to hotel next day, upgrade expired so i attempted to purchase another. my laptop browser would not automatically open the webpage to allow this. now, being a tech savvy person, i know how to troubleshoot the basics. forget the wifi and try again, clear my browser cache, see if the page auto-loads in another browser, restart the computer. funnily enough, i was able to purchase the upgrade on my phone, but still couldn't get my laptop to open the damn page. so, of course i call front desk to ask for the website that should be loading so i can load it manually. if the way the site recognizes you is to enter your room number and last name, *it should be accessible manually*. front desk person was nice enough, but clueless. she put me on hold to talk to someone else who told me to try all the things above again. thanks but no thanks. tried everything 10+ times already. nada. as i type this i'm still on the slow-as-molasses free wifi that says you get 5mb speeds, but i've never broken 2.6mb the entire time. thankfully it's just fast enough to put in this critical review. management: get your staff educated on the website to enter for manual connection to the paid wifi. this is an option, as i've done so at other hotels. i probably won't be staying here again, but i can't be the only person this has happened to and felt it worth noting for others in town for work and not tourism.",yelp
524,"despite its location in the heart of a tourist trap, it was rather pleasant. this was mainly to do with the lack of tourists in early april. i suspect that during high season the experience would be like sitting on top of an ant hill. the only major problem was that each day when i ordered an omelette from the restaurant the wrong breakfast item arrived.",yelp
525,"i cant rave about this place enough, the team / staff is extremely on it, they really know how to host a successful event. laura, beth, andrea, juan, dennis the whole team really knows what 5 star service means. they followed through all the way to the very end of our event. the food was great, all of our guest were extremely satisfied with there guestrooms, and the location of this hotel. its in a clean area of sf with tons a great places to eat and shop. i would highly recommend this venue if you are hosting an event.",yelp
526,the staff at the argonaut always go above and beyond. matthew at the front desk always has great recommendations and a great attitude. great hotel. highly recommend!,yelp
527,"hidden fee, expensive valet. noisy air conditioning, no fan in bathroom. made mistake on the bill.",yelp
528,"the hotel itself is nice. the room was clean, great views. the doormen were always friendly and helpful. the only reason it's getting 3 stars is because of the price. i was aware of the $38/night resort fee or whatever, plus taxes, but i was never informed of the price to park. even when they took the car at check in no one said it would be $65/night. it also wasn't in my itinerary with the price breakdown that was emailed in advance. while i understand city parking isn't cheap, it would've been nice to know ahead of time so i could've looked at other parking options. because of all of the extra fees i likely won't stay again. the $245/night ends up being like $800 for two nights. the front desk gave a lot of attitude at check out and acted like it was my fault because i chose the bay view room package instead of the parking package that i didn't even see. the restaurant is also overpriced and the food is mediocre.",yelp
529,"service was good enough. the rooms are small, but it is hard to find spacious rooms in san francisco. the parking when we arrived was terrible. the front entrance only has space for 3 or 4 cars and it was completely full on arrival. it was a bit stressful to check-in due to the parking. the water pressure in the shower was terrible. would not stay again because of the water pressure alone.",yelp
530,amazing location and a beautiful hotel. we are in san francisco for a major convention and couldn't have founded a better hotel. everyone on staff was amazing and attentive. they executed with precision. we recommend that you have breakfast at the mermaid restaurant in the hotel. the first day we went looking for a breakfast spot thinking that we might want to try something different than the hotel but it turns out their breakfast was pretty amazing!,yelp
531,absolutely love this hotel. this is our third time staying here. it's great location being in fisherman's wharf and the cable cars are across the street. from the moment we valet our car we are treated with kindness. the rooms are very nice and the hotel itself is absolutely spotless. oh and the in-room dining is a huge 5 star.,yelp
532,"stayed here for a super fun extended girls weekend for a 50th birthday and it was absolutely the best place we could have chosen for the tourist things we all wanted to do. it is wonderfully located on the wharf, right down from a trolly pick up location and the famous buena vista and ghirardelli square-but also next to a double deck bus vendor (always changing) that makes the entire downtown loop-including chinatown, little italy, and macy's square. our room was pretty, clean, and roomy and i'd highly recommend the cost for the experience you'll get.",yelp
533,"this is not related to the hotel - i was at this charming hotel for a conference and had then unfortunate circumstance of speaking to an individual (matthew) who was very rude, condescending and unpleasant to interact with. i am an event coordinator by trade and i was considering holding an event here and i may reconsider if having to deal with him.",yelp
534,the hotel is great. concierge and valet staff are phenomenal and really make this a top rate hotel. the lobby is beautiful and the rooms are decent sized (for san francisco). i recommend that you make time to use the free bicycle vouchers and other amenities as it adds to the experience and value. parking is expensive - which is to be expected due to the location.,yelp
535,"my family of four stayed between christmas and new years. the room was clean, beds were comfortable, and staff were helpful. however, the lobby area and lobby bathrooms were generally ignored by the staff. the bathrooms were in poor shape, and without paper towels or hand soap. in the lobby, trash and empty glasses were not picked up, and games for children were broken and had missing pieces.",yelp
536,"their price is $25 higher per night than they advertise. this ""milk the customer attitude"" permeates the experience. when you challenge them on this they have many clearly rehearsed excuses. ""that it is priceline's problem,"" ""that all hotels still do this"" which as all of us who travel a lot know is simply not true any more - it has been years since this last happened to me. when you ask why they don't just include their ""bait and switch"" fees in their advertised price you get a look like you are from another planet. knowing that i was being taken advantage of really ruined the experience for me. i did the honest thing and, before checking out told them it was my policy to warn others of deceptive marketing practices with one star reviews. they took advantage anyway.",yelp
537,"my sister and i stayed here for the weekend and i told my boyfriend that when he and i come back to san francisco that we would have to stay here again. to be honest, the room wasn't the greatest. the whole ambiance of the hotel was comforting; it had a rustic nautical theme, and the decor was really cute. the hotel room just could have been nicer, like they could do a little updating. however, it was pretty clean so i'm not complaining there, i just wish they offered hand soap at this hotel! it's the only hotel i've ever been to that doesn't provide any hand soap. the best thing about this hotel though, is the location. i love being on the wharf so close to everything. it can still take a little while to get where you want to go, even on the wharf, but if you don't mind a 30 minute or so walk then it's not a big deal. i personally like to walk and enjoy being able to explore the neighborhood. one thing that does bother me about san francisco that i'm not sure whether or not gets enough attention (and i've noticed this even in the tourist parts of the city) is the homelessness issue. it saddens me to see all of the homeless people that are around the city. i woke up twice in the morning on my last day here to homeless people outside of our window. it's a pretty pricey place (san francisco), and it doesn't seem like the neighborhoods (nor the people) are being taken care of. it's easy to blame homelessness on drugs, laziness, etc., but in a city that's so expensive ($2500+ to rent a studio) and has more than enough money to do something about the issue, it saddens me. the city is also pretty messy, there is trash everywhere, so i loved that this hotel seemed to be so clean, because i'm not sure i'd feel comfortable staying anywhere else! i do recommend visiting san francisco and giving this hotel a try. this hotel will make your trip because of the convenience of the location.",yelp
538,"great hotel! location, service and family friendly approach was perfect!",yelp
539,"this was a very nice hotel perfectly located near the water. from the entrance you can see alcatraz. close to a lot of attractions. also, their restaurant was very very good. all the staff were polite and engaging. would definitely consider staying the next time we are in san francisco.",yelp
540,"do not stay here! $74 for less than 12 hours of parking along with $238 for a room. horrible customer service, took 2 hours to get the valet to even take and park our car and on top of it nobody asked if we needed help or anything. on top of that we had to unload our bags and carry them up to our room ourselves! so disgusted with this place.. take my advice stay at the marriott it's only a block further down with pull up valet service and better service all around. also the manager told us they'd do ""something"" for us for all the crap they put us through and at check out they said, ""sorry, it wasn't our fault we were slammed last night"". worst hotel experience i've ever had in my life! horrible!",yelp
541,"all you can ask for. nice staff, luxuriously appointed and guaranteed sweet dreams. i'm a 20 year local, basically grew up here and enjoy the wharf and all it gas to offer. well i should just the tourist enjoy such an incredible cultural offering. i could write a separate post on all the hidden gems of history in this area but this post is for the hotel. don't worry and get obsessed about a room with a view as it really doesn't matter your room will be awesome even if the view is to the wall next door i don't care because it is super comfortable quiet and you want to be roaming around outside anyhow. however if you are not a local pay the extra money to get the view why not go ahead and do it. it's fun to hang out in the lobby get hydrated on lemon water and play all the games sitting by the fire and people watching!",yelp
542,"from the minute we pulled up we felt welcome at this terrific boutique hotel. we love the nautical theme and the authentic decor. this is my new favorite hotel in san francisco. it's close enough to the wharf for all the excitement, yet at the same time it feels private. the blue mermaid has great food and we just had a delicious dinner. i will absolutely be back.",yelp
543,"today this late afternoon my husband and i went for a bite to eat at the argonaut hotel and had the pleasure of being served by holly. you're talking about sweet and personable, she's top notch. she believes in making her customers happy and it's genuine. she's not doing it for a nice tip, she just believes in pleasing her customers. beautiful personality, beautiful smile, hard worker and quick on her feet. as we sat there waiting to order, i watched her taking care of her customers and reassuring us she would be right with us. she's quick like step curry. she moves as though she's on a basketball court scoring not 3 points but 5 at each table. she loves her job and her customers too and you can definitely tell she enjoys what she does. i think they should make her the manager of all servers. she should train others to do well too. they'll learn so much from her especially knowing how to serve customers. she reminded us of servers we've seen at the ritz carlton. we hope they realize how blessed they are to have you for an employee.",yelp
544,now this is one of my favorite hotels ever the argonaut it's really beautiful area that it's in is just spectacular you're right in the center of fishing reels worth ghirardelli square is right next to you guys there's a lot of beautiful things that you can do in that area will you will not be bored it's beautiful once again you're right in the center of fisherman's worth you can walk anywhere you want they're if it's a beautiful weather day you can rent yourself a bike or even just walk down wherever you want to walk the food around there is just really nice really good people the staff everybody knows what they're doing then starts if i can give them 10 stars i will be definitely coming back there next time i'm in the area,yelp
545,"i do not understand why this hotel is so highly rated. the location was ok and the room clean, but the window was halfway ground level, so all we could see were people't feet. also, i am not convinced about their key room security system. i got back from an excursion, used the key to enter the room and was very surprised to bumped into a men using the toilet. then i realized that i accidentally entered the room next to mine. my room's key opened another room. i went to the reception desk to tell them just as they were getting off the phone with the man who's room i entered. they investigated, and the conclusion was that ""i probably did not enter the other room"" because their security system did not show that my key was used on the other room. despite the other person confirming my story, they decided it did not happen. i have no confidence in their security system, am not impresses with their patronizing customer service and no intention to return.",yelp
546,"loved this hotel. there was a doorman so no one in lobby that shouldn't be. very clean, big rooms, great hotel restaurant, etc. considering it was in the wharf it was quite at night. for sure tourists area but safe and you can walk everywhere",yelp
547,my bucket list hotel. thank you my daughter for my early birthday hotel stay. always wanted to stay here but it was too pricey for me,yelp
548,"the hotel as a whole was great. the bellmen were awesome and accommodating, they were always friendly and helpful! i didn't interact much with the front desk, however they were great with our limited interaction. i was very unimpressed with the blue mermaid. i only patronized the blue mermaid for cocktails and was served the wrong drink, the bartender seemed annoyed to be servicing anyone. housekeeping was amazing and did an incredible job. the bed and pillows on the other had were sub-par. bed was as hard as a rock and pillows were basically useless.",yelp
549,"stay away from this place, the concept of being polite escapes this property. cars left for valet are not moved causing congestion in the front when trying to load or unload. the doorman did not appreciate said comments and at the time of my visit got a bit upset. this included taking pictures of my license plate.",yelp

552,"awesome hotel, awesome location, great service. totally worth every penny spent to stay at this location. my family and i were pleasantly surprised at how close everything is located within walking distance of this hotel. ghiradeli square is two minutes away, the trolley is 45 seconds away, the harbor is two minutes away and shops and restaurants are within less than 30 seconds away including my favorite, in and out burgers.",yelp
553,"for a 4-diamond hotel property i expected more. rate was ridiculously expensive, but fails to deliver on many standard items that go a long way in terms of guest experience. there is a 'resort fee' charged, but be aware that this isn't a true resort (no pool) and provides little/no actual amenities. also, if you want sweeping city views this property does not provide them. my room faced an adjacent building and i was told that a 'partial view' of the water would be an additional $75/night! disappointing that there was no attempt to compromise on the upgrade, especially considering i was staying 8 nights. in fact, nothing was complimentary here. complimentary water should be provided in rooms, instead there's a $4 charge. fees to access computers in business center?! who does that in 2018? not very accommodating. also, i experienced bed bug bites on my 5th night at the hotel, so that should be remedied immediately. i found features in the bathroom to rather dated, and the bathroom light continued to flicker on and off during stay (room 409). room service and food was prompt and rather tasty, however $10 food credit should be able to be used for room service as well as dining in the restaurant. after all, the guest is already paying for it. in the end, i felt nickel and dimed to death for everything here. that's not how i want to spend my vacation. i'm not confident i would choose the argonaut on another trip to san francisco.",yelp

555,"while it's a good location it is not worth the extra cost a mere one block down from a major chain competitor. the inside no view room at almost $300 where we have listened to a child cry for almost an hour and the amenities of robes were not provided and the extra resort cost is definitely not worth it for a short stay. additionally, we had to pay 45.00 for non valet parking which would have been included with the competitors room and they included breakfast but not here. save your money and book one block up.",yelp
556,"this hotel is very overpriced in my opinion. i didn't see anything that qualified it as a 4-star hotel. the only thing that justifies a somewhat high rate is the location which is pretty awesome. one of the cable car turnarounds is right next door and it's an easy walk to ghiradelli, fisherman's wharf and pier 39. we were there during july 4th and could literally walk 50 yards from the hotel to watch the fireworks. if not for a deal through travelocity i would've never paid the daily rate. then it turned out that on top of the rate through travelocity, we had to pay a daily facilities fee ($25 + tax per day) that covers the use of the wifi, the coffee in the room, the fitness room, the use of bicycles for two hours a day, etc. has to be the first time i've ever seen an extra charge for wifi and coffee. who does that? the beds seemed ok but my son and i both had backaches every morning for some reason. i've seen other reviews complain the thin walls. we did listen to a little kid screaming one morning but otherwise it wasn't an issue for us. the window did crank open a little which was cool. the one staff member at the desk that i dealt with the most didn't seem to know what she was talking about when it came to questions about the public transportation. we had to figure it out for ourselves. other than the location, i can't recommend staying there.",yelp
557,"cute and eclectic hotel across the street from hyde park in the restored brick cannery built in the early 1900s. vintage nautical theme as the name suggests with some odd modern add-ons. weird, artsy wall paper in all the rooms. the nice wooden deck lounge chairs and port hole mirrors made the lobby feel like a ship. the bed is super comfy - not too hard - not too soft. and so quiet! we had a room facing the (very plain) interior courtyard and never heard a door shut or another voice the whole night. lovely bathroom with soft, plush, thirsty towels. feels touristy but all the staff were very friendly and helpful. when we checked in the lady gave us a voucher for 2 drinks in the on-site restaurant and $10 off food.",yelp

570,"we had a great stay at the argonaut. came for husbands birthday and we greeted with a nice card, wine and snacks from the hotel staff. such a sweet gesture and perfect way to kick off the trip. staff was friendly and helpful. our room was a king with a bay view. we had stunning views of the golden gate bridge. can also see the ghirardelli's sign and the cable car station. the room was huge and very clean. the location is was perfect for us. it's at the very end of the pier so you walk all the way up and see everything. lots of shops and restaurants near by. also there's an avis car rental a few blocks away which was perfect as we needed a car to go to napa for just one day. and they let you park in there lot for no charge. hotel charges $75 for parking. there's a great breakfast spot a few blocks away, 8am cafe, worth it. the cable car station is just across the street. over all, would love to stay here again.",yelp
571,"i have previously stayed here and had a good experience. but this time, not a good experience. we got back after the room after a long day and wanted to relax & watch a movie. but couldn't get the volume turned up to a level we could hear it after paying $30 for the movie. called front desk and they sent up technical support. they said there was nothing they could do about it. so no movie for us! really disappointing! went to bed early with no movie or tv. very poor customer service and not a care that we were unhappy. i have never stayed at a hotel where i can't hear the tv. thought i was paying for a high end classy place but i don't feel that way at all! i would not recommend it!",yelp
572,"i do not understand why this hotel has such high ratings. the beds were very firm and not great. the pillows were insanely soft and weird to have with the firm mattress. i asked about whether they had other mattresses and was told no, but they'd call me back to discuss solutions. no one ever called back. we were there for 4 days for my husband to convalesce from some minor surgery so the uncomfortable beds were a pretty significant inconvenience. we didn't need housekeeping for a couple of days but asked for fresh towels. that also did not happen. i really didn't feel the hotel staff had any concerns for us as guests. definitely not a high quality customer service situation, sadly. definitely not worthy of over $1,000 for our 4 day stay. my other major complaint is that the windows have wooden shutters which don't fully close and yet there are lights all around the outside. this meant the room was never completely dark and i found it hard to get to sleep. a minor complaint is that the volume of the tv kept fading in and out irregularly. it wasn't too frequent but the general lack of responsiveness from the hotel staff didn't inspire me to believe they'd fix it promptly- if ever so i didn't bother to request service. there was no market or grocery store terribly close. trader joe's was about a 15 minute walk away so not bad, but not ideal. the restaurants nearby were a mixed bag, but it's a very touristy area so i didn't have high hopes. we could hear yelling in the street on a daily basis and given that the 4th floor we were on was the highest, i imagine all the rooms can hear street sounds too. i wouldn't return here ever nor would i ever recommend it to anyone either.",yelp
573,"stayed here a few weeks ago and loved it! very nice and comfortable rooms. beds were very comfortable. excellent location right at fisherman's wharf and within walking distance of so many shops, restaurants and activities. great staff! got a package with parking included and valet brings your car right up. i highly recommend staying here! you will love it!",yelp
574,"the location is great, but the rooms are really small and unless you get a view room, don't stay here because you end up looking across the patio into a neighboring room. the musty smell reminds me of mold. lastly, any hotel that has pump shampoo and conditioner in the bathrooms should be avoided. it's super cheap and creepy. who know how long and what's in those containers. sound proofing between rooms is lacking as well.",yelp
575,this is a great hotel. i love the look and the people. the ambiance is great and fits the area. the staff is very nice and helpful. i would recommend this place to everyone. good job!,yelp
576,"this is a darling hotel in a great location. it gets two stars for all of the outrageous/outlandish extra charges ($81 for parking, fees for using gym facilities that we didn't use $28). we booked using hotels tonight where they charged us the $28 and then were charged again by the hotel, as well as errors they charged for an upgrade for two nights when we were only there one night. trying to figure out all this mess and double dipping was a huge bummer! check your credit charge statements when you leave.",yelp
577,what a great location. rooms were really nice. i loved the octopus wallpaper and the whole nautical theme. it's definitely worth the extra bucks to stay here. the door men are really nice. one of them had my daughters super pumped on the treasure chest that awaited them in the lobby. great way to start off. my kids were all smiles the whole trip. after walking around seeing the places i avoided i patted my self on the back. i got a lot of your the best dad ever. which is always nice. there's always a lot of decisions when traveling with kids. i am glade i made the one to stay here.,yelp
578,"it was my brother's birthday and the hotel did try to make it special by leaving a note with a complimentary bottle of wine; however the note stated the wrong name. they simply just took the person who booked the hotel and used their last name when that is not my brother's last name. it was a little uncomfortable as that is not his last name. perhaps they could have reached out to the person who notified them of the birthday and asked what his first name was or even his nickname. nonetheless, they tried. i will give them that!",yelp
579,this is our second time staying at the argonaut. the first was about 6 years ago and the service and amenities have improved. we have a bay view suite. the bed is comfortable and there were many types of pillows to choose from. the hotel is in a great location. walking distance to some of the most iconic places in the city.,yelp
580,"stayed at the argonaut again for thanksgiving weekend 2015. under new ownership now. the room was a little worn. carpet and bathroom tile needed replacement. they no longer have the complimentary wine hour which was great not just for the free wine, but i always enjoyed chatting with people from other places. the staff wasn't quite as attentive as before the turnover. otherwise, it is still a nice hotel in a great location and reasonably priced for what you get in that area.",yelp
581,"restaurants all around, ghirardelli 5 minute walk away, inandout burger joint 2 minutes walk. fishermen's wharf right here next to the hotel. great running path and bike path as soon as i walk out the door. i will definitely come back to this lovely hotel.",yelp
582,favorite among favorites. location perfect for grazing the wharf. service is top-notch and the blue mermaid next door is a great meet up place. happy family memories here. really appreciate the effort to retain the brick architectural charm of years past.,yelp
583,"i was so excited to stay here, as i had heard great things about this hotel from my manager. i was very much disappointed. i only stayed here one night. thank goodness because the worst thing about this hotel are the paper thin walls. i had a family on one side of me that were very loud and obnoxious. i was able to hear everything they talked about. then on the other side of me was a party going on. needless to say i did not get a great nights sleep. perhaps i was just unlucky in my nearby roommates but regardless i still think the thin walls would be an issue with anybody, no true privacy. the staff at the front desk were nice which is the reason for the 2 stars, but other than that i feel there are better hotels in the area. also, they nickel and dime you for everything. you can have the small in room bottle of wine for $26, purchase the stuffed sea lion on the bed for $22, a liter of water for $6, etc. nothing is complementary. to top it off, i tried to order room service in the morning and when i called i was told my room was vacant and they couldn't deliver to my room. come to find out someone on the morning crew had accidentally checked me out of my room during the night. so when i went to checkout i was told i had already done so. next time i'm in town i will not be staying here. i should have stayed at the hotel i was at before switching to this one. very disappointed.",yelp
584,cozy hotel at fisherman's warf. it's close to all the tourism and in walking distance to the ghirardelli.,yelp
585,i had a comfortable stay in the hotel. prime location. i am celebrating my honeymoon and the hotel staff was more than willing to accommodate us. the hotel was well maintained and had fun nautical decor. i feel the parking was a bit steep. i definitely recommend this hotel to anybody staying in the san fransico fisherman wharf area.,yelp
586,i loved the location of the hotel! perfect to reach anywhere in less than 15 minutes walking. the decor is so refreshing and fun!,yelp
587,"best hotel on the pier, hands down. we had a deluxe king looking over the park and golden gate bridge. friendly staff and beautiful building. excellent upscale boutique hotel. will be back.",yelp
588,"great hospitality, rooms are very nice, beds are comfortable. i would stay there again!",yelp
589,"stayed here twice during november and december and thoroughly enjoyed my stay! lady at the front desk was very friendly and knowledgeable about the area. loved the christmas music in the lobby and the beautiful fireplace, rooms were clean and had a lovely nautical theme! location was not too bad, close to the water and tourist shops, and not too far from the alcatraz tour dock. the doorman was very friendly and shared with us about living in philadelphia compared to california which was nice to hear about life in the usa as an australian. would definitely love to come back and stay at the argonaut again.",yelp
590,"i have so many wonderful things to say about the argonaut! i stayed at this hotel for 6 nights on business, and i went away with a truly positive experience. years back, i saw the argonaut while on another trip to san francisco, and i always wanted to stay there. something about it just caught my eye. so, when i saw that it had a rate my employer would cover on my recent business trip, i was ready! i tell this tale because i went to the argonaut with high hopes - and they did not let me down. i was not in an upgraded room with a view, but my room was terrific. it was meticulously clean, well-appointed, and very comfortable. my king sized bed offered me a great sleep. the only downer is that the walls did seem a bit thin, and i could hear the neighbors if it was totally silent. fortunately for me, i need to sleep with a fan or white noise of some type, so it was no issue. the staff was also really friendly and accommodating. i wish i could remember everyone that impressed me, but i remember john, frank, matthew, and peter as providing excellent service. best of all? you cannot beat this location! fisherman's wharf is a wonderful location for tourists, and it was just across the street from a beautiful public park, the terminus of one of the cable car lines, and ghirardelli square. there was a huge selection of restaurants nearby, a starbucks around the corner (but you do have a coffee maker in your room), and there were several bus lines within easy walking distance to get all around the city. i have stayed in a lot of locations in san francisco, but this was hands down my favorite.",yelp
591,did a ton of research around fisherman's wharf for a good hotel. the pictures don't lie this hotel is fantastic! the perfect location and the staff is wonderful. we had the standard king room the first night then moved into the king suite with the biggest jacuzzi tub ever for the next two. they moved all our luggage for us as well. everything was clean (which is the most important thing to me) and well stocked. the only negative is the shower - very poor water pressure and shower head stinks! the water pressure in the tub is very strong so it must just be the substandard shower head. however this was a minor inconvenience and we loved our rooms. the theme goes so perfectly with the area and we will definitely stay here again!,yelp
592,"after a reservation snafu, stefan (the manager) offered to do more research on the situation and provide resolution. if this top notch customer service is any indication of the guest experience, then we're off to a good start!!",yelp
593,"my boyfriend and i had a great stay here. the nautical theme was fun. the hotel staff was friendly and helpful. the room was fairly large and most important, clean! the room was quite too. the wine bar is nice. we ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant, blue mermaid. the food and service at the restaurant was good. my compliant, is the bed wasn't too comfortable. spending the kind of money to stay there, you would think they would have better mattresses. all in all we had a great time and i would stay there again.",yelp
594,"if you are having a wedding of under 100 people, we had the ceremony outside in their courtyard and then cocktail hour and reception in the maritime room. i can't say enough positive things about the wedding coordinator chante, who did an amazing job. she was so incredibly helpful and the rest of the staff was amazing. the food was incredible, venue gorgeous! the food tasted exactly like the food tasting and everyone was so happy with their meals. the venue is just beautiful, get married here! i loved every second of it! our family also loved the rooms and had a very pleasant stay. their restaurant also has delicious food. it's also pet friendly, which allowed us to bring our two pomeranians with us. we will come back for our anniversaries for years to come.",yelp
595,"eh, we have mixed feelings about argonaut. it's a cute hotel in a superb location but, unfortunately, some things were lacking. we were going to on our mini honeymoon and wanted to stay somewhere pleasant and romantic. based on good reviews, we thought argonaut would be an appropriate choice. we booked online and i called to mention that it was our honeymoon and asked whether it was possible for them to do something nice for us. perhaps a room with a pleasant view? i don't know, sometimes hotels do nice things for their guests on special occasions. well, the lady on the phone couldn't care less about our honeymoon. she responded that we had to pay more for a room with a view. ok, that makes sense, but perhaps she could sound less annoyed with our request? or at least she could try looking into what was available and let us know? so, we arrive at the hotel and find a bottle of wine with a greeting card - very nice of them, thank you, argonaut! however, the room is absolutely tiny and shares a thin wall with the room next door. so thin that we could hear every word of a phone conversation next door. our neighbor wasn't even loud. that wall was paper thin. we immediately regretted our choice. certainly not honeymoon-appropriate. the view was terrible as well. our windows were facing other hotel windows into the courtyard. i guess we did have to pay extra for something bigger, better, and more private, perhaps somewhere a bit more accommodating to our special request.",yelp
596,"very friendly staff, and the room is clean. great location, near the wharf. parking is a pain. you're best to valet park it, and not worry about it until the next day.",yelp
597,"had a nice break from the craziness of downtown. fish tacos was pretty decent, west coast style. family had salad and something else that i dont remember. everyone was happy with their food. hostess and waitstaff was pleasant and professional.",yelp
598,"my husband and i stayed at this beautiful hotel for our 40th wedding anniversary on july 20th through the 26th. i can't say enough about this beautiful hotel. the views were amazing and the staff, well what can i say. they made sure our 40th was a beautiful one, had the sweetest notes, wine and snacks included in our stay. i am recommending this hotel to all our family and friends. i can promise you when we come back there will be no other place we would want to stay than the beautiful, top notch argonaut hotel. thank you again!",yelp
599,wonderful stay! great location! so convenient to everything in the city yet you feel a bit removed from the tourist scene once you step inside. our room was quiet and had a decent view of the courtyard in the cannery. the beds were comfortable and everything was so clean! my only complaint is that the pressure from the shower head is very weak. i figured we were in ca and there was still a drought so i got used to the shower pressure. we enjoyed breakfast at the blue mermaid- service was good there as well. kinda expensive but you have to remember you are in the middle of the tourist area. the hotel gives you a $10 voucher to eat daily there. the cheapest thing on the menu for breakfast is a bagel for $6. coffee is $5. the cost of the hotel was worth the pleasant three night stay in sf. word of advice if you want to save $ during the trip would be to take the muni. the f trolley goes along embarcadero and the 30 stockton goes straight into the heart of chinatown. the 30 bus experience was like an amusement park ride.... (crazy city bus driver trying to keep up with her bus schedule.... ). sf has a great transit system. you get to feel like a local and it's a way better deal than the tourist trap cable car.... $7 versus $2.75. the muni even gives you extra minutes to ride back. on one of our trips we got a return ride included after 4 hours after our initial departure. sweet deal! another money saving tip is to rent a car from sfo and drop it off by closing to the rental agency nearby. we rented from avis and paid only $16 to rent an suv. we arrived early in the morning and drove down to palo alto and returned the car a block away from the hotel by 5pm. parking and driving in the city is so not worth your time or money.,yelp
600,"this place is right in the middle of everything! it's such a cute hotel! my husband and i celebrated our 1 year of marriage. we receive a wine bottle, snacks and a cute welcoming note from argonaut hotel. the only thing i didn't like was how expensive parking was. 59 per night!! adds up once you check out! which they did tell me about. besides that, this place is awesome!",yelp
601,"ahoy! what a great stay! clean, themed rooms. excellent front desk and bell staff. greeted like royalty ever time i came in and the whole check in was a breeze. great location with everything walkable and would stay again!!",yelp
602,"my husband and i stayed here for our honeymoon before going to hawaii. we arrive and we were told our room was not ready yet. we had to leave our bags at the front desk while we went to explore the town. i would have liked to go to the room to freshen up first. we were told we were going to be given a great room since it was our honeymoon. well it didn't really seem like anything was special about it. the one lamp didn't work and the tv didn't work at first, we had to play with it to get it to work. yeah great room. the room was smaller than i was expecting. the bathroom is so small you can barely move. the only nice thing is we got a small bottle of champagne. i did like the nautical decor and the happy hour. but definately not worth the $400 more a night cost we paid for a small room. i don't even think our room in hawaii was that much. and the worst part about our trip is that we never received a gift package that a friend dropped off to the hotel. i didn't notice her email until i returned home and my husband tried contacting the hotel. no one knew anything about it and could do anything, we didn't even get an apology either. i guess it either got lost and there was no communication at the hotel or some employee must have stolen it. highly dissapointed.",yelp
603,a very beautiful hotel located in famous fishermans wharf. the blue mermaid restaurant has delicious chowder in a sourdough bread bowl you must try.,yelp
604,this is an adorable hotel. it's is very close to the water..the theme of the room was sailor/sea.. very charming with expose brick wall and wood beam post in the bedroom and bathroom. the room was a bit small but clean and comfortable. the staff are very friendly and helpful.,yelp
605,not sure why this hotel got 4.5 stars. their beds are tiny queens. two adults can barely sleep comfortably on them. also cots cost extra where most hotels are happy to supply one especially if their beds are tiny. location and interior design are the only good things about this place.,yelp
606,"great stay! they were overbooked when we arrived and offered to put is in a huge 900 sq ft room for the first night. since we had a lot of stuff and really did not want to move they figured it out and put us in our standard room as expected. the employees were awesome and so understanding. the room itself we had was a 2 queen and it was spacious and clean. service was impeccable and everything in the room was comfy, making for a great stay. he location is perfect as it puts you close to many great restaurants and is right near shopping and cable cars. i cannot imagine a better hotel for our stay",yelp
607,awesome hotel conveniently located in the fisherman's wharf area! love the staff and the nautical themed rooms! perfect place to stay in san francisco!,yelp
608,"the location of this cannery turned boutique hotel couldn't be in a better location if fishermans wharf is your destination. we had a fabulous 2 days exploring all the wharf had to offer. pros of this hotel are the location on jefferson st,the attentive staff, interesting architecture including exposed brick walls and original wood, and nice sized rooms. cons are the awful pancake flat pillows, no extra blankets, very dirty behind bed and nightstand, worn carpets, and no blackout curtains. for the price i'd like to see more attention to details like good pillows and cleanliness. but i would stay here again based on location.",yelp
609,"ive found my new replacement to the fairmont hotel. this hotel was unbelievable. i didn't come here to be a tourist of fishermans wharf. i just had always wanted to check out this hotel and i was finally able to. we booked the king suite. one of the most beautiful, comfortable suites ive ever stayed in. better than any suite ive had at the fairmont chain. it over looked a corner of the wharf, which we opened the window up most of the time to the enchanting bay air. the suite had a huge living room with a door that closed to the bedroom that was also giant. the bathroom was also expansive. the bathtub was incredible. its huge. a family of four could comfortably sit in it and actually swim. i couldn't stay out of it. i got in in the middle of the night and i got in as soon as i woke up. i couldn't get enough of this bathtub. i lounged around in my complimentary robe every second i could. the bed was very comfortable. i loved the bedding set. everything was just perfect. going back to the fairmont comparison, this giant suite was $200 cheaper than a regular room at the fairmont. can you believe that?! its so worth it if you can do it. the hotel is wonderful. service is fast and efficient. there are obviously lots of things within walking distance. we walked down by the beach, we walked and got brunch the next day. this hotel has become my happy place every time i reminisce about my stay.",yelp
610,"i have stayed in many san franciscan hotels but i think the argonaut may be my favorite. i have always been intrigued and when a good deal presented itself i bit. i was so excited for months and once we arrived it was better than i dreamed. before we walked into the hotel, the doorman was loading our stuff onto a cart and welcoming us. we were very early and didn't expect our room to be ready but marilyn? checked us in and found us a wonderful room with an amazing view. such a small action made such a difference in our vacation because we were able to get settled and enjoy our hotel that much longer, thanks to her. she was super sweet and i can tell she rolls out the red carpet for everyone she helps. the rooms are huge and even have doorbells! the service by all staff members was exceptional and felt like a family environment. the doormen and bell hops seems to genuinely enjoy being at work. we loved the lobby with its fireplace and with complementary citrus infused water. the location is fantastic in touristy fisherman's wharf. if tourist traps aren't your thing, that's ok, the cable car or bus stop is close by and can quickly whisk you away to less visited areas of town, as we prefer to do. one of my favorite things to do when visiting is ride the cable cars at night for stunning views of the city and shorter lines. it was so nice to be staying close to the line. i will most likely stay here again.",yelp
611,"an expensive hotel. it's right smack in the middle of the tourist area called fisherman's wharf. checking in was a breeze. they do give you your room key(s) and then another actual physical key. the front desk was explaining it so fast that i missed what it was for. it's not for the safe. it's actually for cabinet to access the fridge. for the price i paid, i expected some sort of view. my view was of the roof of the 1st floor where the air conditioning units are. wonderful! better off elsewhere.",yelp
612,hubby surprised me with a get away here for our anniversary. very conveniently located and service is wonderful. pricey but hey it's san francisco. bed is super comfy and the coffee is delicious.,yelp
613,this is a nice hotel and we really enjoyed the doorman. he made us laugh every time we saw him. this is a great location that is centrally located to most of the attractions that we wanted to visit.,yelp
614,did a lot of research on best hotels to stay in san francisco prior to our visit. picked argonaut based on great reviews.hotel is conveniently located at the end of fisherman's wharf. unique nautical decor. the beds were very comfortable and rooms quiet. the staff was very helpful and friendly. i would give it a five star but we found the bathrooms a bit small for our liking and the closets need lighting. we will definitely stay here again on our next visit.,yelp
615,great location and clean room. friendly staff anytime we asked for anything. our room faced hyde street with a view of the golden gate bridge.,yelp
616,the location for this hotel can't be better! it was just walking distance to pier 39 and being able to just walk a few steps out your hotel and see alcatraz in the distance was surreal. management at this hotel take there job seriously and make it a point to make sure that guests are well taken care of and have a good experience. i just recently went to this hotel and will be going back as soon as possible. just want to thank guysell and the staff there for making our trip and our first time in san francisco memorable.,yelp
617,loved this hotel! from the moment we pulled up we were treated like royalty. they found out we were on our honeymoon so the bellhop had wine brought up to our room. they also upgraded us to a room with a great view of the golden gate bridge. they were so sweet and accommodating they made our stay that much better. every time i think of san francisco i'll think of the pleasant experience i had at the argonaut. the blue mermaid was absolutely delicious also which the hotel gave us drink vouchers for. i couldn't be happier.,yelp
618,"we decided to go to hawaii for our honeymoon and my wife planned her dream vacation. we thought it would be a long commute from the philadelphia area, so we should cut our flight in half and stop by san francisco for a few days before we reach hawaii. i took it upon myself to surprise my wife and found what i thought would be a great hotel, the argonaut, near the wharf. when we arrived, our room wasn't ready and the front desk clerk was extremely friendly. she assured us that they had a perfect room for us on the top floor as requested and it would just be a bit longer. we decided to walk around the city for a bit and when we got back to the hotel our ""room"" was finally ready. we were given keys to the third floor though. i tried to inquire why, but they assured me that was the room they had for us. waiting in our room was a nice bottle of champagne and candy from ghirardelli. there was a card wishing us a happy honeymoon, but on the back of the card was a three digit number starting with 4, so i'm assuming that was the room we were supposed to have. the room looked similar to the photos of the room we wanted, so who really cared? we were on our honeymoon. in the room, a lamp didn't work and the television wasn't plugged in. we had the light fixed quickly and i plugged the television in myself. the hotel had a nice happy hour, where we could grab some free beer and wine. most of the staff were incredibly friendly until after we checked out and i had to contact them. my wife knows the daughter of a woman at her work and she lives in the san francisco area. this woman personally dropped off a gift basket/wedding gift at the hotel. we didn't find this out until we were in hawaii and the woman asked if we received the gift. i still had the card with the other room number, so i contacted the hotel to see if they had the gift and possibly delivered it to our original room. the hotel told me that they didn't have the gift and they were pretty cold to me. i emailed and tried contacting them again to get a hold of another person who could possibly help me and no one could. the manager tried to cover it up by saying they weren't sure why we were moved, but they wouldn't have delivered anything if we weren't in the room. as i mentioned in my final email to them: although our stay wasn't bad, we are put in the position where we have to decide if a close friend, who asked us if we got the gift she personally delivered to the hotel to surprise us with, lied to us or if someone at the hotel kept the gift for themselves. update: our stay was prior to the argonaut being taken over by a new ownership group. i have been contacted by a representative from the new company and he has assured me that there are a lot of new employees. i have no way of knowing if the employees we had issues with are still there or not. i have been assured that our experience would be better the next time, but we still have no desire to return. i have also been told that the happy hour that we enjoyed is no longer available. when i inquired what replaced that, i was basically told to experience it for myself and to contact them for the best rates. that's not a great selling point to me, so i'm not sure if there is anything that special there other than the great location.",yelp
619,"my husband and i celebrated our anniversary here. from check in to check out, we loved everything about this hotel. every single member of the staff we had any contact with was friendly and helpful. our room was comfortable and cozy. the fisherman's wharf area is a sentimental favorite of ours so this hotel is perfectly located. we were within walking distance of everything we wanted to do and see on this quick visit. we're already making plans to come back and are looking forward to another stay in this lovely hotel.",yelp
620,"we were disappointed this time staying here, we stay here a couple times a year. first, requested room close to elevators, i recently had knee surgery and needed something close, got room down the hall not close to elevator. when checking out, requested to stay 1 hour later, was denied. not great with customer service. one would think a repeat customer of several years, they would honor customer loyalty, they didn't. and we stayed during the week, so it wasn't peak times or weekend. very disappointed.",yelp
621,"stayed here recently on the recommendation of a friend, and so happy that we did! we splurged on a bay view queen room that looked out on the trolley turnaround and the sf bay and golden gate bridge. the room was clean, spacious, comfortable, and quiet. i loved that we could go downstairs for a full breakfast in the restaurant (good breakfasts) and then just walk to everything from the hotel--over to fort mason, down fisherman's wharf, down the embarcadero to the ferry building. splendid!. barring that, it's so easy to take an uber and avoid driving and parking. staff was very friendly, including the concierge who booked us at green's in 5 minutes and drew us a map of the walk to get there. i can't wait to visit again and stay at the argonaut! it's pricey, but worth it!",yelp
622,"my husband and i love this hotel we got engaged at this hotel about 2 years ago so we can't see ourselves staying anywhere else. we just stayed here again his weekend and it was what we remembered from our fond memories. from the outside service to the front desk, the service is impeccable. they are all very friendly, accommodating and professional. my husband spoils me so we stay in the suite with the hot tub and love love love it! the room is extremely nice and we feel right at home when we come here. the best part is is the hotel is located within walking distance to fisherman's wharf which we love. i highly recommend staying here.",yelp
623,my wife and i stayed for 3 nights at this hotel and we couldnt have had a better time. the hotel staff for polite and friendly and always willing to help with anything. the rooms were very clean and comfortable. the location cannot be beaten and we had a great view of the bay from our room. i would recommend this place to anyone who wants to visit san francisco.,yelp
624,super happy with our stay here!! after getting checked in they offered to upgrade us to a room with a view. the location and views are absolutely gorgeous! we are literally steps from the beach and steps from fisherman wharf. the hotel itself had a nautical feel decor. the rooms are spacious and the staff was amazing. overall i would stay here again!,yelp
625,"this time we reserved our room through expedia and couldn't have been happier. price was reasonable. we had a deluxe king room with a view of ghirardelli square, the cable cars and a peek of the bay. don't waste your money on the overpriced view rooms (unless you can get a good price) this was perfect! room 238 was big, clean and comfortable! everyone was super friendly and nice and again the location is fabulous! will definitely be going back! too much fun!",yelp
626,stayed here for my first trip to san francisco because of location and reviews. very pleased with the choice! the staff was welcoming and friendly--especially marilyn at the front desk who gave us great suggestions for site seeing and restaurants. the location is right in the heart of fisherman's wharf and the building is historical. i would return without hesitation!,yelp
627,"this is a nice boutique hotel with excellent access to fisherman's wharf. it's overpriced and the rooms are a little too small and uncomfortable. i'm glad we stayed here once, but i don't think we'll be back unless we can find a really low rate. not a bad experience overall.",yelp
628,kitschy but cool nautical theme. nice lobby space with a fireplace and several seating areas for hanging out or playing games. rooms are spacious and some have exposed brick and beams. reasonable but not cheap. right in the heart of the tourist attractions along fisherman's wharf so plenty to do within walking distance.,yelp
629,"so i've stayed here a number of times. it's a nice hotel but i'm 2 starring it because of the pretentious bs. i've booked rooms from their website and from discount sites. the regular rooms are great. they keep what i can only assume are rooms for chumps who rent on third party websites. here's my experience today. i'm driving into the city from work so i can catch a flight tomorrow. i check their website and the discount sites. discount sites are 50$ cheaper. out of courtesy because i like the hotel, i call them direct and see if they will honor the rate i found on every other third party site. the lady who answers checks her third party rates and claims she doesn't see the same and declines to match. i triple checked to make sure all of the sites had the same. she makes no counter offer for what she allegedly sees. so i say thank you and book thru a third party. this is the second time i've done this and they have done this. the hotel has no idea who i am. i arrive and a new guy checks me in. he's gracious polite and efficient. i head to the room. yup they shoved me all the way in the back, and it's a long slog from the elevators. which would be ok if the room weren't a deliberately under-furnished pos. the other rooms have a lovely couch and desk arrangement. i have the same sized room with a desk and a single tiny sad dirty little chair. there is a giant gap on the wall where the couch should be. and the bathroom has hair in it. plus the bath mat is scummy with mold. so tell me management? how sad is it that you actually keep rooms that you refused to put the normal furniture in and don't maintain as well just for third party bookings? i know the hotel isn't full tonight. i checked the vacancy level. when these guys have their a game on it's nice but they actually train their desk staff to lie. you will actually have a better stay at a hampton or a holiday inn.",yelp
630,"this hotel is ahhhhmazing! we stayed for 3 nights and didn't want to leave. the staff starting from the gentleman in a uniform were all so pleasantly helpful and sincere. the location is wonderful. my husband and i walked to the alcatraz ferry, pier 39, cable cars and gheredelli square. the walls are paper thin that will be my only complaint. our next door neighbor liked to leave his tv on all day and all night. they came back to their hotel room with 2 other people (no biggie) at 2am and their conversation which was not loud but sounded like they were standing at the end of my bed. i knew i could count on the staff to address the concern with a phone call away but i decided to not bother. the food, hospitality and decor is top notch and will always be my go to place in the fishermans warf area.",yelp
631,"as our tickets to san francisco were nearing, i urged my boyfriend to book at the argonaut for our fun trip in the city. when it comes to location, this place to rocks! i think fisherman's wharf is the ultimate place to stay in the city! this way, you can be close to attractions like alcatraz, pier 39, and epic views of the golden gate bridge. growing up, my dad would always book at the argonaut. our stays at this venue are particularly nostalgic for me because some of my favorite family memories were spent here. i remember being infatuated with the aquatic style decor and outfits worn by staff. as a child, this place was wonderland! returning as a now, 23-year-old, i saw the hotel much differently. it is still spectacular but for the price, it didn't exactly meet the mark for me. now the style of the hotel looked a little bit tired and in need of a revamp. the staff seemed less cheery than i remembered too, in fact, they all seemed a bit disgruntled. it was a hard pill for me to swallow that the hotel was not as magical as i had remembered! this is not to say that this isn't a fabulous hotel! i just believe it is a bit tired in its theme and lacking in effort.",yelp
632,"i've been coming to the argonaut for years, in fact i got married here! they have always been super friendly and accommodating. they love our dogs and always give them treats! the front desk always makes sure i get the room we love. the hotel itself is located in an old canning factory. it's gorgeous and they gave it a sophisticated nautical feel. plus, it's always spotless. rates have always been very reasonable. it changed hands recently and now noble house runs it. it's exactly the same, maybe even slightly better! book a room here. you will be thrilled!",yelp
633,"this was one of the best hotel experiences i have ever had! upon arriving in mid afternoon in the hustle and bustle of fisherman's wharf, we were a bit flustered with traffic and where to park. when we pulled out in front of the hotel, the staff instantly warmly greeted us and gave us directions on where to park. although they do offer valet parking for $50 per night, we opted to self park behind the hotel (that is not affiliated with the hotel). they grabbed our luggage for us while we parked which helped us from lugging all our heavy baggage across the street. check-in was easy, and we were amazed by our nautical themed room. it was very spacious, clean, and beautifully decorated. we were stunned that every room even had their own doorbell! the lobby was also cozy with a fireplace, plenty of sitting room, and had an attached restaurant. although we did not eat at the restaurant, the menu looked appetizing and it was nice to know it was a place we could go to for a snack if needed. we loved this hotel not only for the ambience, but also because it is in the best location in fisherman's wharf. unfortunately, the location is probably why it was on the pricer end. it is located right on the main street across from the piers between ghirardelli square and all the wharf's shops/restaurants, so you have easy access to eating and entertainment without taking transportation. we were sad to leave this hotel, but we will be back!",yelp
634,"the argonaut has beautiful architecture and stylish decor. the beds are firm but comfortable. at first i was disappointed about our lack of view, but quickly realized we had a much quieter room than one on the street. there is even a doorbell to our room, which i've never seen before, though minus one star for the bright blue light it shone into the room all night. i think it was a great idea that the refrigerator with snacks for purchase has a lock, in case any youngsters get left in a room alone for a spell. it is a quick walk to the water and the maritime museum across the street is a highlight. the staff were very friendly and helpful. we enjoyed our breakfast from the blue mermaid located right beside the hotel. i appreciated the use of refillable soap dispensers rather than wasteful single use ones. i would definitely come here again.",yelp
635,"reservations were easy to get. room looked recently remodeled. very cool nautical theme. room was very clean. staff was very friendly and genuinely interested in our satisfaction. beware, parking in the area is very expensive, and the hotel is no exception. the hotel charges parking by the day, $50 per day, but you are allowed to take your car and drop it off as much as you like without additional charge. we left our car at the hotel for the entire duration of the trip. we walked, took uber, and got tickets for the ""hop on hop off"" tour. i'm sure we saved money that way. everywhere we went, parking looked scarce, and driving seems very stressful. the best part of the hotel is the location. so much to do within 1 mile of the hotel, it can even seem overwhelming. but throughout the entire trip, we did not see a hotel in a better location compared to argonaut hotel. on our next visit, we will be returning to this hotel.",yelp
636,"actually was quite disappointed. after reading the hotel reviews, i was confident i'd made a wise choice in making my reservation at the argonaut. arrived at the hotel at approximately 10:30 pm and there was no assistance with luggage, nor any luggage carts for self use. there is no reception area with any available coffee or tea. even holiday inns make coffe and tea available. room was small but clean. washcloth had holes in it making for another poor impression. the first morning we went to the blue mermaid for breakfast. the restaurant had very few patrons yet service was slow. food was delivered to the table cold. had no interest in dining there again after that experience. the evening prior to our departure, i stood at the concierge desk while the woman went about her business without so much as an acknowledgment that i was there. i have to admit the reason i'd return is because of its location. within reasonable walking distance to all the piers and shopping and any water excursions. trams are approx 3 blocks from hotel. if you don't expect much in the way if service then i highly recommend the argonaut, however i will be looking for another hotel in the fishermans wharf area for my next visit to this fabulous city.",yelp
637,"boutique hotel with extremely clean rooms and classy, unique decor. i stayed here for a weekend away with my husband and we loved that our room looked out on the bay and the cable car turnaround. our room furnishings were perfectly comfortable and very unique with a brick wall on one side of the room, very quiet. super slow service at the concierge desk and the concierge was absent much of the time we were there. the free bikes to borrow were especially appealing! personally, i don't love fisherman's wharf but this hotel is at the far end of the madness, next to a very pretty park and a short, flat distance to some interesting bars and the ferry building. i would stay here again.",yelp
638,"loved this hotel and it had been updated when we visited in summer 2016. lovely room, but beware the room service. it is slow and forgetful. we would stay again, though due to its location, style, museum, and looks.",yelp
639,"absolutely wonderful fantastic hotel! great location! this was my first trip to san francisco, but my husband has been a few times for conferences and he said he always walked by this hotel and wanted to stay here. so we did! we got a room with a view of the bridge and alcatraz island. so beautiful! the area was busy with lots of vacationers. not a lot of kids at the hotel, mostly couples. we asked the concierge desk to help us a couple of times. once to rent a car so we could drive to muir woods, sausalito & golden gate park; and she gave us great info for a day we walked around to coit tower...such as don't miss the food market at the ferry building. and a second time for transportation back to the airport. we reserved a towncar and it was only a few dollars more than uber but less hassle. we took the cable car to union square one day and ate at sears diner and after some shopping, went to china town and ate lunch and bought some tea. then walked to coit tower and down the filbert steps to levi park and walked back along the piers. another day we took bikes down to fort point. took lots of pictures, the fort has beautiful architecture and an interesting history. then we rode across the golden gate bridge to sausalito and ate lunch and ice cream and then biked back across the bridge in the fog (very cold and it was july!) and went to the palace of fine arts before returning the bikes. (there was a ferry from sausalito but the line was so long, we chose to ride back) we did go tour alcatraz island (get your tickets online as early as u can!) and hung out at pier 39 afterwards. this hotel is close to the cable car station, ghirardelli square, great restaurants, museums, bike rental shops, alcatraz pier, shopping, pier 39, lombard street...well almost everything. we ate at the blue mermaid a few times for breakfast and once for dinner. all our food was good especially the chowder flight.",yelp
640,"we stayed here while on the first half of our honeymoon. the hotel was great, clean, convenient. the staff even left a surprise bottle of champagne to congratulate us on our honeymoon, which was really kind. the only thing that bothered us was that we felt the concierge (we met with two separate staff members) were less than helpful. they seemed to give us quick answers and acted rushed. you can imagine that a couple who are visiting san francisco for the first time might have a lot of questions about what to do and how to get there. we felt uncomfortable asking all our questions there.",yelp
641,"although the location is supremely ideal, the valet parking is a long wait, and is overall not a good price for what you get.",yelp
642,"just arrived, and so far it's great! the staff is was extremely helpful from the bellman/doorman, front desk, a great choice in a perfect location. the concierge gave us a great place to eat in north beach, and it was excellent. it was also kid friendly, a good mix of guests!",yelp
643,beautifully decorated and great location. tip: don't stay on bottom two floors they can be loud with sidewalk at window level.,yelp
644,cute little boutique. awesome service. room was clean and smell fresh. reasonable price for a great view of the bay.,yelp
645,"the argonaut is a beautiful hotel in a great location in san francisco. the staff is amazing and couldn't be more accommodating. the room oversaw the action packed jefferson street and we had a wonderful view of alcatraz island. the room was spotless. the cleaning staff did a great job. we enjoyed the restaurant downstairs, the blue mermaid. we'll stay at the argonaut when we come visit again! thanks!",yelp
646,this was our second visit to the argonaut we had an amazing stay in january 2013 and had been eagerly awaiting our return visit whilst the room location and staff remain fantastic the changeover from a kimpton hotel to noble house has stripped away those little extras that made the hotel so welcoming and took it into the great category no longer is there hot chocolate available in the lobby on a cold afternoon and no evening wine reception which made the lobby such a social environment the childrens treasure hunt and babysit a goldfish programs have also been ceased the room and beds are comfortable even for a family of 4 with plenty of luggage however this trip we suffered the problem of thin walls one night with a crying baby on one side and two yapping dogs on the other other nights were no problem so probably just luck of the draw that particular night we enjoyed our stay mainly due to the staff and location but hope noble house consider reinstating some of those special touches in the future,tripadvisor
647,very nice and comfortable property great beds and pillows no fan in the bathroom so mirror fogs when you take a shower the toiletries are large bottles that you pump it would be nice to have individual ones beware they charge a ridiculous resort fee and the only amenity is a workout room that we never used,tripadvisor
648,we had planned many months ago to stay at fishermans wharf because we wanted easy access to fishermans wharf for our daily walks we switched to the argonaut at the last minute when ta reviewers alerted us to the fact that our previously booked hyatt at fishermans wharf was undergoing noisy disruptive renovations we are very glad we made the change we knew it would be more expensive but this was a special trip for us as we were celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary there is much to admire about this hotel the front desk staff were very welcoming and knowledgeable when we checked in in fact all the employees we met in the halls at the front door and everywhere were unusually friendly and pleasant when we arrived in our room we found a lovely congratulatory note from marc with a complimentary bottle of good wine very nice touch our room was small but adequate and we loved its excellent view of the wharf the waterfront and alcatraz we were pleased we had paid extra for a bay view room and recommend room 446 to you we also enjoyed two different breakfasts at the hotels blue mermaid restaurant and service by christa but were too busy to use the free chowder coupons they gave us three problems 1 this was the worst business center we have ever been in and we regularly use them in hotels all over the world they charged 795 for 15 minutes usage and most of that time was spent waiting for slower than oldfashioned dialup service and reading unwanted popup ads not at all worthy of a firstclass hotel like the argonaut in fairness we must say that they took one of those charges off our bill when we complained 2 the shampoo conditioner and liquid soap all are so high on the shower wall that they are not reachable by anyone preferring a bath 3 there is only one chair in the room making it difficult to dress watch tv read and chat if you are a couple,tripadvisor
649,although the hotel itself is nicely done and the rooms are big much bigger than we thought the value for money is at the lower end also the lobby and bar area are somewhat not inviting its really more a place to sleep but not hang around in the evening and for this the price is too high then one rather choses a nice hotel in the business district for the same money,tripadvisor
650,the hotel is in a former manufacturing facility they have preserved some of the 4x4 beams and ibeams etc and try to integrate with the decor however the nautical theme is tacky and poorly down rooms c just about enough space for a king bed and your luggage a bit rundown staff d surly and unhelpful location b+ in the heart of waterfront along the piers,tripadvisor
651,we stayed here primarily to be close to the wharf and cruise ship terminal areas since we knew wed be doing a great deal of walking we chose a suite with a jacuzzi tub the room was enormous a spacious living area that had a large dining room table couch and chairs as well as a large bedroom area one of our favorite features of the room was that it was a corner unit and we had a lot of windows we could open to get some fresh air the tub was a bit difficult to get in and out of but a welcome respite at the end of our long days the staff were very knowledgeable and helpful any time we had questions or sought restaurantbar recommendations overall we had a fantastic stay and will most likely consider staying here again in the future,tripadvisor
652,great staff amenities the lobby is cool the rooms offer nice decor with red brick walls and a large bed we had a view overlooking the bay street and the room was quiet with the traffic below would recommend to others to stay,tripadvisor
653,first stop on our honeymoon was san francisco the argonaut hotel is situated perfectly for sightseeing in the city rooms were tidy and of okay size no honeymoon champagne thoughboo although theres an hour of free wine and beer in the hotel lobby loved the theming would stay again,tripadvisor
654,my partner and i visited argonaut while we were in california in september 2016 we arrived the hotel late afternoon with our hired car the valet service was excellent quick and efficient they took care our luggages and sent them straight to the room the checkin was seamlessly quick and we got offer an upgrade to a suite and we took it it was the best choice ever the room was spacious clean and beautiful the naval style design with excellent fabric and a warm mixture of colours made you feel like home my favourite parts of the suite were the bathroom and the view from the suite the suite has a walk in shower and a huge bathtub with the view of fisherman wharf from our suite we can see alcatraz and golden gate bridge it was breathtaking the concierge lady was extremely helpful she helped us to get a table in a local well known restaurant gary danko which apparently the reservation for a table can be demanding as it always fully booked we were very pleased with that if i have to pick on the downside of the hotel i would say the price and the noise insulation you can clearly hear the conversation and people walking down the hallway from your bed i would recommend argonaut hotel to any travellers that visit san francisco for the first time or a frequent travellers that been many times well done,tripadvisor
655,booked the hotel several months ago as part of a 6 week usa trip the rooms and all public areas were kept really clean and all the cleaning staff always had a smile for you the other staff were all very pleasant but there seemed to be some resentment about handling your own bags which i had not come across in the 20 or 25 or so other hotels i had stayed in during our 9 state trip i asked to use a trolley which again have been available in all the other hotels but was told they are only for the bell boys use i dont mind paying for a service but i dont being pushed towards it im sure the management are going to come up with some excuse like health and safety rather than it being a way for staff to make up their low wages the other thing i was not aware of is that it is a pet friendly hotel which in our case meant being woken up 3 morning in a row by the people in the next rooms dog barking the resturant was ok as was the bar but quite costly certainly a great location for the wharf area but that said this was my first time back in 20 years and its not the clean historic place it used to be,tripadvisor
656,we stayed as a family in july 2022 what can i say right next door to the cable car a short walk from ghirardellis close to fishermans wharf and alcatraz is literally the first thing you see as you walk out of the lobby extremely comfortable great service gorgeous styling i come from the uk and very much hope ill get to stay here again one day,tripadvisor
657,charged double for room once they have got advance payment then they carched same amount from creditcard and caused costs for telefon calls with austrian bank raiffeisen and our travel agency to refund the ammount carparking charged usd 8050 overnight whithout informing the guest before check in this is not acceptable even in bellagio las vegas tehy charged only usd 30,tripadvisor
658,we were welcomed to the argonaut the moment we stepped out of the cab until the moment we left it was our 45 wedding anniversary so the young lady at the desk gave us an upgrade and had a bottle of wine delivered to our room the room was clean charming and most comfortable,tripadvisor
659,fantastic hotel in the best possible location pier 39 alcatraz tours restaurantseverything you want to see is within easy walking distance of the argonauts front door inside the rooms are well appointed clean and the beds are super comfortable very quiet at night wifi worked perfectly recommended for those who are willing to spend a little more to be within walking range of everything,tripadvisor
660,i dont understand the positive reviews my room was full of mold and mildew the furniture was worn way beyond shabby chic there were holes in the carpets and there were stains on the bed skirt no soundproofing i could hear coughing talking and worse i dont often write reviews but i feel compelled to warn others especially because i love sf and hate that some tourists will leave embittered by their experience at this hotel,tripadvisor
661,my girlfriend and i stayed here a week and had a nice comfortable and relaxing stay every night staff was prompt and excellent and so was housekeeping will definitely come back to this hotel next visit,tripadvisor
662,from my pov after a few stays best hotel for that area even if you are not anymore into fishermans wharf you are close to cable car end point which goes directly to city centerunion square very authentic very nice,tripadvisor
663,we chose the argonaut from the lonely planet guidebook for a twonight stay in san francisco to break the trip from the uk back home to nz it had friendly helpful knowledgeable staff is in a great location and features guest rooms of high quality i wouldnt hesitate to recommend it,tripadvisor
664,staff were friendly if they knew you were a guest my partner smokes and went outside to do so and was promptly told to move until they realized he was a guest dogs allowed and i did not like their doings in the foyer rooms were very nice though the coffee making machine in the bathroom location was great for what we wanted,tripadvisor
665,great location lovely hotel right by all the tourist area the rooms are very light in the morning very expensive breakfast should be included for the price we wouldnt recommend it go to holiday inn express they give you breakfast the only thing this hotel gives away is a glass of water no pool no gym,tripadvisor
666,from the moment that we checked in to our sad departure didnt want to leave the staff was exceptional our room was perfect spacious clean comfortable and quiet restaurant nice lobby area had room to sit by the fireplace play chess and board games or read a book loved that we could open our window in our room and hear the sounds of fishermans wharf we were serenaded every evening by a very talented sax musician i would highly recommend to all to book this hotel for their next trip to san francisco excellent location,tripadvisor
667,a perfectly located hotel for visitors looking to spend time in the city of san francisco just across the street from hyde street pier near fishermans wharf ghirardelli square buena vista caf piers 39 to the hyde street pier the cable car pickup and cable car museum if you are a walker chinatown is not too far away but remember that the streets in san francisco are hilly so you will get a great hamstring workout walking up those hills and a great quadriceps workout walking down the service at the hotel was really wonderful with the doormen eager to greet help and find you transportation if need be we were glad we did not rent a car as parking is difficult to find and expensive too but really not necessary due to easy walking share ride shuttles cable cars bart subway taxis uber lyft and even some pedicabs the fun nauticalthemed dcor rich in blues creams reds and whites with exposed brick wide planked floors and interesting marine and boating accessories the room and lobby did not disappoint as they looked even better than in the pictures posted online we even noticed how the wallpaper in our 4th floor room had been hung matched the pattern perfectly and we could not even find the seams clean linens covered comfortable highseated beds in the lobby cozy chairs flank a warm fireplace and a fruitinfused water dispenser invited thirsty guests paula our favorite concierge knew the where hows and whats of the city the wellequipped workout facility on the second floor got very little use from us due to all the walking we did in the city dogs were seen but not heard nor smelled a wine bar attached to one side of the hotel invited us in for happy hour and adjoining the other side the free maritime museum part of the national park encourages visitors to learn about pacific coast maritime history although the blue mermaid restaurant tempted our taste buds we elected to explore the myriad of restaurants and food booths at the docks we reserved our 4th floor room about three months in advance and although the cost for one roomtwo people for three nights ran about 1100 including tax but we discovered that that prices for most places in san francisco were that or more expensive remember to ask for veterans aaa or other discounts when booking the only drawback we had was that we requested a room with a view as advertised but when we arrived the only room they offered was a room with a view of another building with a small courtyardunless we wanted to upgrade for 150night it made no difference as we enjoyed all the other amenities the closeness of the activities and the service provided tripdvisor will send information on deals to your email if you sign up i would definitely stay here again,tripadvisor
668,hotel is dated and kind of dingy bc of it room was on ground floor with no space btwn active tourist street nice to be close to water but it was way too hokey for our taste i recommend finding a newer hotel,tripadvisor
669,the hotel is in a beautiful and very coinvent location however when we arrived our room was dirty there was dust on everything almonds on the floor the usb device was filthy dusty and sticky the concierge sent us the wrong way on the bus which ruined one entire day for us the bartender was excellent and provided us with great restaurant recommendations,tripadvisor
670,this is a boutique hotel the building has a rich historyworth checking out the free tour given by park ranger was very informative everyone was quite friendly and helpful the hotel is situated across the street from fishermans wharf and an easy walk to pier 39 and many restaurants our room faced a courtyard full of windows to the next hallway of roomswouldnt do that againwe thought it would be quieterturns out that we were incorrect our room was well appointed albeit very narrow i had a huge problem with my asthma in this roomwhich means either mold or dust its an old hotel so it could have been either we didnt spend much time in the room anywaybut if you have allergies beware,tripadvisor
671,i stayed at this hotel 12 nights if you are looking for a unique boutique tourist hotel in the middle of the fishermans wharf this is a fantastic choice the positives are that it has an incredible location and is easy walking distance to everything touristy near fishermans wharf the decor is completely nautical but is tastefully done the rooms are also very unique and finished well the restaurant and full bar are good choices the only downsides are that you will generally pay the prices associated with a highend luxury hotel and if you are a business traveler the location is far from most businesses but still an easy uber ride away overall i would highly recommend this hotel,tripadvisor
672,stayed 4 nights at this lovely hotel we had booked in at the hilton but transferred here and it was a very good decision lovely privately run hotel great staff comfy rooms and a brilliant location to explore fishermans wharf couldnt recommend it highly enough,tripadvisor
673,the hotel was only for one night we had a meeting to attend the next morning and didnt want to have to drive super early we arrived late and the original room had quite the party going on next door after a quick consult with one of the staff members we were moved the new room was amazing this hotel is smack in the middle of some of the best sights in sf you have the wharf alcatraz the gg bridge and ghiradellis we had a lovely time and definitely added this place to our list of hotels that well use in the future,tripadvisor
674,great hotel right across from the wharf district walk to si many restaurants hop on bus start and cable car all 1 block away views to alcatraz friendly staff and very nice rooms would stay here again,tripadvisor

677,i chose the argonaut for a friday night stay when i picked my girlfriend up from the airport and planned to make my proposal for marriage the staff went above and beyond to make our stay special and we were able to be upgraded to a wonderful room view on the top floor the hotel is in an awesome location so theres a ton of stuff to see and do all within easy walking distance we had a fantastic experience and were both grateful for the friendly staff and beautiful room well done and thank you all,tripadvisor
678,extremely thin walls where i could hear the conversation next door perfectly the staff was nice overall a bit expensive for what you get in terms of finishes and views my window looked directly into another room staff was nice,tripadvisor
679,fantastic location fantastic decor we loved our stay in one of the suites the linens beds are super comfy service was great we cant wait to return we loved the national parks mmuseum hyde pier crab walk away and much much more,tripadvisor

681,we returned to this hotel to celebrate our anniversary and were not disappointed the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful the hotel is clean and well kept up the location in relation to tourist attractions is perfectmost things are walkable or there is access to public transportation we ate in the restaurant twice once for dinner and once for breakfast dinner was very dimly lit and loud breakfast was brighter and quieter the food was good we cant wait to return for another visit,tripadvisor
682,we loved the argonaut hotel the location cant be beat we walked down to pier 39 and to the alcatraz tour dock the views of the bay are amazing the staff was very sweet and surprised us on our birthday trip the rooms were clean and very spacious we would definitely stay here again,tripadvisor
683,i loved this hotel the location was amazing right by the beach with easy access to everywhere the staff could not have been more helpful and friendly the food was lovely also i loved wine hour and our room was gorgeous i could have slept in the bed forever free wifi a huge bonus in san fran was also really good the only downside was the really expensive parking but everything else was amazing i am normally pretty critical of hotels but this one really ticked all the boxes,tripadvisor
684,you just cannot go wrong with this hotel location and the quiet little maritime museum at the foreground of their lobby is a must see for san fransisco enthusiasts great staff wonderful maritime themed lobby and rooms good grub at the blue mermaid linked to the hotel definitely will miss the wine receptions but all in all a must stay in the city,tripadvisor
685,we usually stay closer to union square but decided on a change of direction everyone at the hotel was very helpful the room was great we looked out over the courtyard which was probably the quieter side i imagine the sides that faced the street were much louder we never heard any street trafficthe only available king room when i made our reservation was a handicapped room but i so no problem with it the only minor complaint was not much counter space in the bathroom plus it is just across the street from buena vista so i definately got my irish coffee fix,tripadvisor
686,we thoroughly enjoyed staying at the hotel save for the slightly cheesy decor service so sotherefore its really all about the location down on the waterfront dont eat in house try to venture further out and about to enjoy the location,tripadvisor
687,what a great place this is right in the middle of things down in fishermans wharf the rooms were set out in a sailor kind of theme which was great they were always kept so tidy also they had a wine an beer hour every afternoon at 5 i think an that was great to just relax an have some free drinks an taste some of there amazing clam chowder the restaurant there is exceptional i dined there twice in my 3 night stay the location is good with views of the bridge right outside it would definitely stay here again,tripadvisor
688,we have stayed here on several trips to san francisco love the proximity to fishermans wharf and the cable cars lovely evening social hour in the lobby valet parking historic building national park maritime museum in the lobby and actual museum ships on display just across the street from the hotel great service unique rooms,tripadvisor
689,this hotel did not disappoint we ended our spring break vacation 1st stop napa with a two night stay in a king one bedroom suite at the argonaut and it was lovely from the valet to the front desk guest service was wonderful they offered us fiji water and guest wellness kits with face masks sanitizer wipes and spray hand sanitizer upon arrival the one bedroom suite was described on the website as approximately 600 sq ft but it seemed much bigger perhaps we were upgrade it had a comfortable living room with pull out sofa bed which we used for our kids and a nice dining table perfect for a family the suite had exposed brick walls giant wood beams and beautiful white wood window shutters the nautical theme was tastefully done to our surprise they sent up a complimentary bottle of wine and welcome note on our first night the hotel is in a perfect location on the quieter end of the wharf but close enough to walk to pier 39 and ghirardelli square lots to do and plenty of food options and souvenir stores the bay company across the street has quality clothing and souvenirs with great customer service highly recommend the argonaut,tripadvisor
690,great hotel in wonderful location at fishermans wharf nice spacious rooms with bridgealcatraz views good tv free wifi courteous attentive staff free winebeer reception for 1 hour each day was a welcome bonus,tripadvisor
691,this is a great place for getting the feel of san francisco there is a need doggie welcome in the foyer the furnishings by the fireplace are comfortable a welcoming happy hour is fun my room was furnished with a maritime motif the window opened a rarity with most hotels the blue mermaid next door has a great breakfast menu housekeeping is only soso but you cant have everything there is one strange workerstephen the bellman does little besides cavorting around the sidewalk not much help in getting cabs,tripadvisor
692,we stayed for 6 nights in a corner suite on the top floorthe suite was very large with a fantastic bathroom the bed was comfortable and the sofa bed was better than average the room along with the whole hotel was spotlessly clean and very professionally run all of the staff were great and the concierge zakhida was very helpful before my arrival in sorting out a really good itinerary of trips the view from the room was of alcatraz and the gg bridge we enjoyed breakfast most mornings and had one dinner in the restaurant all were very good as were the staff free water is available and there is availability of coffee in the rooms we asked for a kettle and tea bags and these were provided the only negative for me was that someone used the street as a race track each night to rev their motorbike luckily it didnt go on beyond about 11pm but did go on all late afternoon and evening which was very annoying obviously not the hotels fault and beyond their control there are lots of restaurants and cafes close by as well as shops and transport we enjoyed our stay and would like to thank the staff for their hard work and can recommend the argonaut as a great place to stay,tripadvisor
693,we loved our stay at the argonaut where so many iconic san francisco attractions were right outside our door we indulged in the blue mermaid restaurant twice for convenience and quality but more economic options were also in easy walking distance the concierge was most helpful in assisting us to make the right choices for our stay and see the things we most wanted to see,tripadvisor
694,arguably the best location in san francisco end of the cable car line minutes walk to the alcatraz port pier 39 lombard street and a fantastic views of the bay nautical themed rooms were well designed and gave a homely feel with all of the above taken into account the best thing about the hotel is the happy hour which is in fact free beer and wine tasting it turns the bustling foyer into a mecca of wine and beer connoisseurs who share their tourists experiences highly recommend staying here and will be revisiting san francisco,tripadvisor
695,i rate the argonaut as average as i thought that the hotel is ok starting with the pros in that check in was smooth with the staff being polite they provide 10 vouchers to the blue mermaid for each of the days you stay upon entering my room which was a standard room decor is nice while accommodations were clean and tidy rooms arent large which is fine for those that are alone no so much for families the walls in the rooms are thin i hear everything people coughing to the movement of the bed in the room next door this part for me made it a poor experience overall the argonaut is a good hotel id stay again given its price and proximity to a number of things to do in the area,tripadvisor
696,stayed in early oct including the fleet weekend although booked a year ago was given a room on 2nd floor as was told that higher floors given to those only here for a day or two and we could move to a higher floor tomorrow why not just preallocate rooms as a lot easier price very high and aligned to top hotels in london eg the ritz but dont feel you get same level of quality love the sustainability of hotel but toiletries dont feel local nor do the have any aroma of citrus or tea tree feel like they have been in bottle too long why not just put enough in for the stay and keep it fresh also on sustainability why not put free water in rooms charging 5 for evian how is evian in a sf hotel room sustainable i know fresh water in lobby but that in a small jug in each room would have been a bit of a wow rooms are so comfortable and very clean had pillows changed and a little issue with shower was fixed with no fuss the hotel has such friendly charming staff they cant do enough for you just be honest and polite and they are the same back including those who park the cars was the one chance to blow me away with quality as not likely to be back in the bay area for a number of years but sadly it missed the chance it is an amazing location for quality of its staff match the price but sadly not the quality of the hotel,tripadvisor
697,we stay at the argonaut every year during fleet week in a great location located near fishermans wharf and ghirardelli square the staff is always helpful and attentive we look forward to our next trip to sf and the argonaut,tripadvisor
698,the argonaut was perfect for my husband and i it was our first time in san francisco and the location and atmosphere were great it takes about 10 minutes to walk to pier 39 but its a great walk with bay views its also close to ghirardelli square and there are tons of restaurants right outside the hotel doors well definitely be back one day,tripadvisor
699,this hotel with its great nautical decor is in a perfect location opposite fishermans wharf despite being on the tourist strip it would have been remarkably quiet at night if only the family in the room next to us didnt have their tv blaring all night till 3am when we finally called guest services and asked that they do something about it it required a second call to get anything done and finally it was quiet despite the lack of sleep we would return,tripadvisor
700,beautiful rooms and very welcoming concierge and checkin they also appear to be dogfriendly the hotel is located central to all the essential piers and walking distance from buena vistas renowned irish ciffees,tripadvisor
701,great location near fishermans wharf with a view of golden gate bridge from our window the hotels restaurant the blue mermaid is excellent with good food and very helpful and efficient staff we found reception to be brusque though offering no guidance about the area and no water when we arrived though other guests received bottles from other reception staff water in the room is priced at 8 for a litre bottle also there is no actual living breathing onsite concierge except on one day a week fridays we were told i find that extraordinary for a hotel in this price range,tripadvisor
702,between location value room size and service this was one of family of fives favorite hotel stays in comparison to jw marriott four seasons hotel del coronado and similar hotels we stayed in a one bedroom bay view suite at the end of march even with a king bed queen sofabed and a rollaway we had more than enough space no one was tripping over suitcases or felt like they couldnt move around it was like an ideal first apartment just without a kitchen what we loved besides the space location right between ghiradelli square and fishermans wharf you can walk or take public transportation to all the major tourist or business spots in the city beautiful view of the bay plenty of restaurant options nearby right next to the cable car stop concierge bernadette paula and michael were so knowledgeable and helpful and hooked us up with great ideas and discounts they also arranged our airport transfer for our arrival with five of us plus luggage it was more economical for us to take a private van service they arranged for a go lorries van to meet us 85 total bikes the hotel has 14 total passes per day for two hour complimentary bike rental at blazing saddles just up the hill on hyde street you do need to line up early in the morning to get them but its worth it with the hotels location you can get right on the bike path and ride out to the golden gate bridge lobby the lobby was warm and inviting with a fireplace plenty of seating and table games service everyone we encountered was so helpful and friendly marvin the bellman stood out in particular the only downside about the location is that you get some noise from the bars nearby if youre traveling with small kids who need to get to bed early ask for a room on the hyde street corner the side closer to ghiradelli sq tip for families even though youll want to ride the cable car for the experience take the streetcar around the city for 10 total our family rode all over getting on off several times with free transfers the argonaut was the first of four hotels we stayed at during our trip through california from sf to coronado and by far our favorite of this vacation we would love to come back and highly recommend it,tripadvisor
703,hotel was fine concierge gave terrible recommendations nicest guy but bad advice front desk not so helpful location was great near fishermans wharf room was adequate sized and clean restaurant was fine,tripadvisor
704,hotel was very clean and the staff was very friendly great location centrally located to many restaurants ghirardelli square hop on hop off tour bus and cable cars definitely would stay there again,tripadvisor
705,the argonaut hotel is perfectly located for many of the sites within walking distance across the street is the cable car turn around and it is within walking distance to pier 39 and all the shops and restaurants in between bikes are available for guests to use at no charge and it is close enough to the golden gate bridge to ride across the staff especially brook who works in the concierge department could not of been more helpful she was able to pull a rabbit out of the hat and get us tickets for the sold out trip to alcatraz the rooms are clean and roomy we stayed in the standard king and although it was nice when i got a peek in the deluxe king rooms i wished i had spent more and booked one of them nice brick details in the room and it was larger we had breakfast in the hotel restaurant most mornings called the blue mermaid chowder house the food was good and comparable in price to other breakfast places in the area i would definitely stay at the argonaut again on our next trip to san francisco,tripadvisor
706,great location close to fishermans wharf and trolley station staff very friendly and the room was very nice bar and restaurant has a lot of local flavor we totally enjoyed our stay and recommend the argonaut as probably the best place to stay at fishermans wharf,tripadvisor
707,we wanted a quick weekend getaway we chose the argonaut for the location and were pleased with all that it had to offer definitely would stay there again all of the staff that we encountered were super friendly and helpful room service was super accommodating,tripadvisor
708,very much enjoyed our stay in this hotel in great part due to the wonderful view over alcatraz and the bay its location was just perfect for us being at the quieter end of fishermans wharf but within easy walking to restaurants cable cars and the golden gate bridge is only a flat 4 mile walk away we did walk back from union square one day which was fairly flat through china town although this maybe too far for some the rooms were lovely and the staff very helpful wed definitely stay here again be aware this is no longer a kimpton hotel so the free afternoon wine is no longer provided,tripadvisor
709,great hotel on wharf quiet friendly beautiful historically designed building close to cool sites for the whole family schooner museums minigolf trolly ghirardelli chocolates clean quaint hotel with class,tripadvisor
710,this was our second stay and we are so glad we were able to come back special thanks to marc he is just amazing and made our stay something to remember our room was with a bay view and its worth it very interesting watching the street come alive in the morning the room was fantastic super comfortable bed and just the right temperature the bathroom is lovely i took the time to have a bath this stay and it was really nice to be able to sit back and relax we had breakfast at the blue mermaid chowder house bar which was delicious and filling just what we needed with excellent service the front of house staff were all lovely too the hotel location was ideal for us it was easy to get around to the sites we were visiting and is only a short bus ride the f bus from town for shopping again the gym was working well and clean this hotel is just plain amazing and we cant wait to come back again next year,tripadvisor
711,loved staying here the location is fantastic the rooms are very comfortable with all conveniences and the history of the building cant be beat there are lots of surcharges on the bill though these cover the extras like a tour of the historic site bike rental and and andjust make sure you are informed up front,tripadvisor
712,yes this was on my bucket list because it is located in the cannery near fishermans wharf the building is about a century old or so loved the nautical theme we stayed in a inner room which was very quiet the room was spacious and very clean the beds were comfortable also there are robes and a yoga matt it is located in a quieter part of fishermans wharf next to the maritime park the only downside was the windows did not open in our room and i felt the room air was very dry just know the staff does not seem to be able to multi task for example we were in the elevator with the bellhop who let the door shut on us and ignore us because he was so into a conversation with another couple about which entertainers they both knew he did not even push the button for the floor we were all going too also the front desk ignores you when they are on the phone they do not even smile to acknowledge that you are there,tripadvisor
713,the rooms are great youre looking out at the golden gate bridge and alcatraz while being able to walk to fishermans wharf pier 39 buena vista irish coffeehouse the hyde street trolley car turnaround and the blue mermaid restaurant which is really great and on the premises i love going for fleet week 4th of july new years anniversary and my birthday i fully recommend the argonaut youll be back,tripadvisor
714,great location at fishermans wharf with views of the harbour and easy to walk to local restaurants pleasant room attentive staff and convenient onsite restaurant hotel is a converted warehouse so quirky,tripadvisor
715,it is the staff that make this hotel they were really friendly and bent over backwards to help us my husband had a broken ankle and was on crutches the staff could not have done more to make our stay comfortable they upgraded us to an accessible room and also gave us a later check out time so we could prepare for our journey home the doormen were lovely and greeted us like old friends every time we returned to the hotel especially the fantastic donovan who insisted on wheeling my husband all the way to our room while regaling us with some great stories he is a gifted storyteller and a really nice man thank you donovan also a special mention for brooke on the concierge desk for some outstanding restaurant recommendations verbena and amarena nice touches in the hotel including free wifi if you join the kimpton reward scheme and a happy hour with free drinks every day to be fair the hotel decor could do with a bit of an upgrade as it is looking a bit dated and tired now not up to the standard of one of the kimpton hotels we have stayed in in new york however i would recommend this hotel because of the staff also very convenient for boat trips and the powell hyde cable car but bear in mind that fishermans wharf is quite touristy so may not suit everyone as a location,tripadvisor
716,location of this a hotel is excellent rooms are very small but decorated very tastefully our room was in the basement and window was at floor level facing directly into street so not very private we needed to keep shutters closed at all times,tripadvisor
717,we stayed in this hotel because the zoe nee tuscan did not honor our reservation that was made in january 2017 and confirmed two weeks before our arrival it was actually a blessing we really like the argonaut and it is now our go to hotel in san francisco it is very friendly clean and convenient,tripadvisor
718,having made the decision to stay at fishermans wharf on this trip to san francisco we decided to stay at the argonaut based on tripadvisor recommendations we were very happy with our stay great service great room wonderful bed plenty of room close to everything it was perfect for our stay and while not cheap nothing is in san fran we will definitely stay there again,tripadvisor
719,came to san francisco for my daughters august wedding she selected the hotel and i looked it up on the website before visiting im not including any of my photos of the room or lobby because the website very accurately portrays all the details my suggestion is to go to the argonaut hotel site and all the photos will delight you the hotel has exposed brick on the wall in the rooms which makes it very charming and large slat window shutters also very charming the windows from my room gave a nice view of the courtyard around the hotel it was fun to open my 4th story window and look down at the people walking by enjoying san francisco my room was very comfortable i had two queen size beds each night id fall asleep immediately the bed is that comfortable the bathroom is roomy and very clean it has amenities that assure youll want for nothing a hairdryer is hung in a bag by the shower i missed it the first day very subtle the way this hotel places things for the guests use in the closet there is an iron ironing board a safe for valuables and something that came in so handy one day a good sized umbrella downstairs is the blue mermaid restaurant on the morning of the wedding i ordered room service for breakfast i was surprised and pleased at how quickly my order was filled it arrived within 15 minutes and it was delicious my room had a coffeemaker with coffee packets that made hot delicious coffee there is a large comfortable lobby area to sit and relax or wait for familyfriends iced water is available and a fireplace that is very cozy to sit next to every single staff member was genuinely friendly and niceone day i sat for a while in the lobby and they were consistently happy and pleasant to everyone they encountered and although its a very busy hotel there is never a rushed feeling from the staff the doormen are very helpful and so polite in a very welcoming way since this was my daughters wedding i was constantly looking for tissues for my happy tearsand while waiting for the wedding shuttle i had used all of my own the doorman had a box at his station and was so happy to give me some and chat with me to calm me down this hotel has clearly thought of everything a guest might need i recommend this hotel for your san francisco vacation being right on fishermans wharf is a perfect spot food a pleasant park to walk about a trolley stop and shops are nearby i had an excellent time my daughter had suggested i stay an extra couple of days after the wedding to relax and im so glad i did im not a huge tourist sightseeing person and this location allowed me to enjoy san francisco in a quiet way just walking and eating and enjoying my favorite pasttme people watching for those who do enjoy sightseeing this is a perfect hotel to be your base enjoy,tripadvisor
720,we loved our stay from the moment we stepped in the door the history of this building is unbelievable and we were treated wonderfully our room was a bay view suite that was beautiful the exposed brick is the way to go you can see the golden gate bridge from your room as well as alcatraz you are around everything on fishermans wharf so fun,tripadvisor
721,we had an awesome experience at the argonaut hotel i cant think of one negative aspect of our four day visit therewould love to return to not only san francisco but also the argonaut if possible book a room with the view of alcatraz you would not regret that decision,tripadvisor
722,we stayed there over four nights in august and really enjoyed the hotel the two beds in our room were very comfortable and still left us with plenty of room to move around the decor was pleasant and fun it was reasonably quiet considering the area it is very centrally located and there is going to be a certain amount of chaos going on outside arrange for a higher floor if you can the attached restaurant and patio is very nice and we ate there twice on check in you will be given a 10 credit for the restaurantbar which is a nice touch they have a bike rental for free as well i believe staff were pleasant and accommodating,tripadvisor
723,while san francisco is deteriorating by the minute this hotel is an oasis ky was our front desk manager he was instrumental in our trip being a success the hotel is beautifully appointed and kid friendly but with adult options everywhere the room service is fast put your sign out before 2am and it will arrive when you asked ky showed my son the treasure box which was such a treat as we checked out he also helped tremendously with our room the food at the blue mermaid is fantastic and the hotel gives you a 10 per night credit you must charge to the room and it does not work with room service the views of hyde park and ghiradelli square are fantastic ask for the hyde park room view the powell hyde turn around is literally next door get there by 8am and there are no lines the famous ghiradelli chocolate factory is up one block there are three incredible ships to tour 15 for adults free for kids under 15 right across the street the old fashioned trolley lines are two blocks down on a budget go to in out burger a half a block away lombard street up 5 blocks the pier and all it has to offer is right down the street you simply cant go wrong with this hotel its the third time ive stayed there safe convenient quiet and expensive and worth it ky thank you,tripadvisor
724,i love that this hotel is close to everywhere i want to be ghiradelli square cable cars go cart rentals fishermans wharf pier 39 are all walking distance i love the exposed brick in the rooms it was built on the site of the old historic cannery the bluemermaid restaurant has the best crab corn chowder you must have a bowl the staff has always been superior the rooms clean im a clean freak and quiet my fave is the king suite with the jacuzzi bath tub because after walking all day youll need it im not a wine drinker but there is a wine and cheese hour every evening some rooms have a view of alcatraz and the golden gate bridge,tripadvisor
725,fabulous location clean and neat hotel i would stay here again beware of extra charges resort fee and 85 for parking with parking tax instead of feeling like they nickel and dime you i wish the extra charges were included in the nightly rate as a total,tripadvisor
726,we received great rates and an upgrade for what i still consider some of the best designed hotels in the west they are not pseudo luxury but good quality fun and the attention to detail is still great i love the overthetop nautical themed decor the building itself is in a refurbished historical building and alone it is a satisfying place to be with exposed brick and old beams the warf location is still a bit tacky and not to my taste but it is near the water walkable to the park and other points if interest i think this area is slowly changing for the better easy access for jogging along the water front and close to a trolly pick up spot the bed was comfy and the location is quiet the shower is not amazing but i rarely find amazing bathroom in cities without paying a premium price it was clean and nice enough though we received a ten dollar voucher for the restaurantabout equal to 34 of one persons breakfast all in all a really solid choice for the city,tripadvisor
727,we decided to spend our anniversary in san francisco so why not try the argonaut hotel first time here and most certainly not the last great service fantastic rooms with comfortable decor and very spacious we only stayed one night due to our schedules but that didnt matter well worth it highly encourage this hotel as its close to everything and if you want to get to the piers hop on the trolly just one block away and your there in 5 min,tripadvisor
728,spent 4 days 3 nights in this modern well furnished hotel situated along the north shore it is located in the tourist belt with many shops and eateries the rooms were modern clean and had two large queen beds the staff were kind to give my family of 6 adjoining rooms although they were the furthest from the lift lobby they were also next to the street behind the hotel and often we would here people talking and cars zooming by in the middle of the night the toilet was large and fitted with modern toiletries the shower was powerful and provided a nice hot shower which was nice when coming in from the cold winter the only but significant shortfall was the lack or parking facilities a valet service was available at us60 day i managed to get round this by parking at the street side lots for free but this takes good timing and a bit of effort to find a lot near the hotel so unless you have to dont drive to this hotel,tripadvisor
729,there is something special when i entered the argonaut the fireplace is roaring the tree is lit and the staff goes above and beyond to make sure you stay is wonderful our room overlooked alcatraz and the restaurant offers a wide variety of food and drink even for a vegetarian like me the location is perfect right across from the docks or a hike up to lombard street will get your blood moving plenty of places in the area to eat shop or enjoy the sites it feels a bit like home now when we visit,tripadvisor
730,first class staysecond time staying there always in great condition hotel is wonderful clean and in a great location they even sent me a birthday surpriseeasy in and out if you have a car but you will be charge for parking,tripadvisor
731,after a long flight from the uk the argonaut hotel is exactly what was required the staff are courteous the rooms spacious and well appointed most importantly the beds are super comfortable aside from that the location is ideal for fishermans wharf trips to alcatraz ghiradelli square and the start for a bike ride across the golden gate bride to sausalito i would highly recommend this hotel,tripadvisor
732,excellent experience location was perfect providing easy access to fishermans wharf cable car ghirardelli square cruise boats room was beautifully decorated and very quiet providing a very nice few days oh yeah even the weather cooperated sunny 70s,tripadvisor
733,we booked trip at argonaut hotel the pictures online look better than the real thing carpets were dirty noisy in halls we called for room service at 8pm and was transferred to front desk front deck told us in room dining would call back never did we ended up going out and looking for restaurant that night we were very disappointed overall took advice from doorman about eating at another local place for breakfast ended up getting sick from omlette we will not be staying at argonaut again room was small they had some lounge type chair by window not enough room for it,tripadvisor
734,service location room with a view food happy hour overall ambiencestaff from doorman to checkin concierge housekeeping bartender chris bellmanall professional friendly and focused on customer service,tripadvisor
735,we stayed here for 3 nights in june the room was large with a huge comfy bed and a chaise longue nice bathroom iron ironing board coffee machine what did make us laugh was the leopard print robes in the wardrobe only in san fransisco the hotel was in a great location on fishermans wharf the tram cable car terminus is right next to the hotel which was great as we got there early one morning before the crowds arrived there is a good bike hire shop a few doors away too which is ideal if you want to cycle across the golden gate bridge which we did the hotel has a happy hour every day between 56pm with free yes free drinks sangria white or red wine or beer so we took full advantage of that before going out as san fran being a city is not cheap to drink we enjoyed our stay here wouldnt hesitate to stay here again,tripadvisor
736,recently stayed at the argonaut for four nights we found everything that has been stated in previous reviews are correct it is right at the golden gate end of fishermans wharf the tram terminus is right outside so handy to catch one of the old cable cars as is the buena vista cafe old and with loads of character and good for breakfasts lunch or dinner as for the argonaut itself it is an old canning factory and has kept all its character all staff from reception to concierge doormen to barwaitress staff are friendly helpful and simply good a special mention for donovan on the door great character we walked into the city centre probably took about 50 minutes but easy to do but being san francisco its hilly but the best way to explore the streets if we went back to sf it would be the argonaut every time,tripadvisor
737,this marks my second stay here thats right second stay in 4 months at the one hotel in san francisco is it a cheap hotel not in the least bit is it worth every dollar you have spent on it you bet no other hotel compares to the friendliness of the staff special shoutout to marilyn and mari carmen on the front desk and matt the concierge who were three of the happiest bubbliest chill professional and friendly people i have ever come across in my life the dancing and singing in the lobby the chicness of the bar the nautical theme what a way to hotel spotlessly clean beautiful views of alcatraz and they upgraded my cheap as chips hotwire booking to a gorgeous 4th floor room which was gigantic and the view was incredible i didnt want to set foot outside thank you again to the triple m threat you have made my year and i will be making this the only hotel i stay at and recommend to my fellow aussie travellers worth every frickin penny close to everything a stones throw from ghirardelli square and the tram stops you cannot do better position wise,tripadvisor
738,great hotel lovely rooms with loads of character and the staff were so helpful we arrived late and when i gave our name they said theyd been wondering when wed be turning up nice touch a fab location first visit but hopefully not the last,tripadvisor
739,stayed for 8 days with no issues the staff are friendly and well trained the location is excellent as there is a blend of locals and tourists in the area creating a nice vibe great restaurant attached and lots of options close by everything feels like its in walking distance the interior design of the rooms is excellent and very welcoming very clean and up to date great team great environment,tripadvisor
740,we spent three nights at the argonaut our first experience in san francisco great location on fishermans wharf easy walking distance to attractions building is a renovated warehouse owned by the national parks a lot of character the room was a nice size clean and well appointed the staff was very friendly and helpful really enjoyed our stay alcatraz is a must visit the cable car is a block from the hotel visit the cable car museum muir woods is awe inspiring,tripadvisor
741,love the location of the hotel strategically located by the end of fisherman wharf west side within walking distance to pier 39 and famous restaurants like gary danko scoma buena vista cafe the room itself is decent spacious living room and a huge bathroom there is also a free happy hour from 56pm where they serve free wine beer at the lobby cons there is no hook near the shower to hang your towel hate the ac whenever it kicks on i can hardly hear the tv if you are in the living room pillows are flatlike 180 degrees flat there are many other hotels around this area im not sure if i will stay here the next time i am back,tripadvisor
742,hotel is beautiful staff over the top everyone friendly food decent right around the corner from everything 10 minutes to wharf on foot theresa at conciererge was very helpful and gave us great tips on where to go,tripadvisor
743,plus location and very helpful stuff minus horrible showers when i serve in the army my shower conditions was better we also have problem with air condition and toilet not good enough for the value,tripadvisor
744,the place was clean spacious and near water it was a very relaxing experience its not too easy to get to the place by public transportation but bay wheels bikes worked well you can take polk st which has a separated bike lane for most of the way from the downtown area,tripadvisor
745,we loved this location close to everything and restaurants nearby were fabulous room was a great layout and had plenty of room bed very comfortable food in restaurant for breakfast was good appreciate being treated so well,tripadvisor
746,this hotel was our first stop in a 3 week road trip around the west coast of america and we were couldnt have been more pleased with the location being on fishermans warth we were only a short walk away from pier 39 alcatraz ferry departures lombard street and some fantastic restaurants once the morning fog cleared you got a nice view of alcatraz and there was a small beach not far away for a nice morning stroll the room itself was spacious for the 4 of us with two large double beds which were suitable for me and my brother to share one without arguing at all friendly staff willing to help and point in the right direction and offering recommendations for areas to eat in future i would look to stay again because of its wonderful location and comfy rooms,tripadvisor
747,i booked the hotel for a holiday for my wifes 40th birthday having read the reviews and it more than matched expectations the staff could not be faulted and were friendly helpful and very welcoming the room was far more spacious than i had imagined it might be and it was exactly as per their website although the tiger and zebra print dressing gowns were a bizarre but hilarious addition location wise it was perfect whilst on fishermans wharf it wasnt in the midst of the main area so fairly quiet and with it being fleet week we had a great spot to see the air displays it was also right next to the hydepowell cable car turnaround although queue early as it takes a while to board and only a 510mins walk to masonpowell cable car turnaround which is slightly quieter and easier to board because it is right at the foot of hyde and near the hyde cable car turnaround it features on a fair few pictures and guide book covers also if you want to visit alcatrez its only a 10minute walk to the departure pier and 5 mins walk to boudin bakery and pier 39 while the view from our room was a courtyard it didnt really effect our experience and was very quiet the staff aware we were staying for a birthday left a bottle of champagne in our room upon arrival which was a fantastic touch free wifi which was very fast and reliable was also a benefit,tripadvisor
748,stayed here 5 nights great location for all things near fishermans wharf hotel is pricey but location is perfect concierge services were also excellent hotel restaurant is also quite good would stay here again,tripadvisor
749,the argonaut hotel is one of those small boutique hotels that truly delivers the staff is incredibly accommodating and friendly the main lobby is inviting and a great place to chill while waiting for a lyft or dinner reservation as a family of four we were incredibly comfortable in our 4person 2queen bed room with a cool view of the trolley car turn station and the golden gate bridge we stayed from christmas until new years eve steps away from lots of tourist spots we loved the walkability of this location highly recommend for couples or families,tripadvisor
750,four star good location close by the piers within walking distance to eateries along the strip street cars run frequent stops to downtown union square for shopping november is the best time for visit with more deals and tranquillity,tripadvisor
751,room was very large even with 2 queen beds great location and good restaurant with outdoor seating all of the staff members that we engaged with were super friendly and helpful i would definitely consider this hotel on my next trip,tripadvisor
752,excellent service tenzien was the bestbeautiful property cleaning service was great food and service was great in restaurantgreat location took cable car to cable car museum and spent time in presidio checked out museum in lobby great location,tripadvisor
753,charming san francisco vibe hotel in walking distance to everything at the wharf great customer service and great food will stay again when we go to sf beds were comfortable great view of alcatraz from our window and great restaurant attached highly recommend,tripadvisor
754,from start to finish chose to stay here due to a great deal as we usually do not stay at the wharf great priceor was it easy reservation wonderful service at the get go bell man john was a great guy and took good care of us car was parked 80 a night pretty usual for the city but that is still pretty steep even for sf check in a breeze our dog was welcomed and even had his name on the board as a vip guest they truly doted over him beautiful property at the end of the wharf in the old cannery building it was nice to have the grassy area below ghirardelli square and above the aquatic club to walk the dog during togo times our room was very small but well appropriated clean full sized bath tub and nice linens no view only a wall we had the loudest air conditioner ever we would have turned it off but there was not a window to open and it was very stuffy without air now back to the price which also included sf lodging taxes entertainment fees and of course the dog depositwe managed to rack up an 850 bill for our two nights in a very small room now to add to this every area of sf was wide open in the evening except the wharf everything including the hotel restaurant and the buena vista across the way was shut down promptly at nine every other district told us the curfew hours were liftedsono clue so much for a night cap,tripadvisor
755,the hotel is very nice historical building was restyled keeping some element of the old building the living room is very beautiful the room is spacious with beautiful furniture the hotel is clean silent the personnel very nice and gentle the position is strategical negative thing parking cost 75 usd a day but everywhere is the same however with a bit of patience outside can be managed using the meeter with almost 28 usd a day the restaurant marmaid offers a large menu and for breakfast also they made lots of stuff and amazing cappuccino the hotel offer a daily coupon of 10 usd to be used to the restaurant weather for breakfast or lunch or dinner we highly recommend this place,tripadvisor
756,had a great stay and would absolutely recommend this place based on location the rooms are a little tight but the view and location are totally worth it lots of things in walking distance and being able to walk out in the morning to see and hear the bay was amazing,tripadvisor
757,had a great stay at the argonaut the staff were very helpful with queries about the area the location of the hotel is perfect rooms were spotless i would stay here again when coming back to san francisco,tripadvisor
758,we booked this hotel based on trip adviser reviews they proved to be very accurate the hotel is centrally placed on fishermans wharf next to the cable car terminal and ideally placed for all forms of public transport the rooms are well themed spacious and clean there is free wifi with good bandwidth the staff are very friendly and attentive happy hour each work day between 5 and 6 pm provided for cheap drinks and 1 oysters food is of good quality and reasonably priced this is where well stay next time were in town,tripadvisor
759,wonderful hotel located in the perfect location to explore san franciscos north shore fishermans wharf pier 39 ghirardelli square hyde st trolley and alcatraz small hotel that is a converted 1800s cannery with exposed wood beams and original brick walls in their rooms would highly recommend getting a room with a view of the harbor with their corner suites having great views of the golden gate bridge and alcatraz limited amenities but on site restaurant and bar but with so many restaurantsbars within walking distance this posed little downside for us,tripadvisor
760,spent a few nights in this hotel at the beginning of may we had a room on the 3rd floor facing the bay and alcatraz island the hotel is very well located if you wish to visit fishermans wharf alcatraz lombard street and the ferry building the house used in the filming of mrs doubtfire is also not very far away in steiner street if the silver screen holds your interest there are many other movie locations not far away also the hyde street cable car terminal which gets you downtownis just around the corner from the hotel as are some fine restaurants for breakfast the hotel internally is well appointed with a nautical theme throughout the rooms are spacious bed is comfortable and everything works but it is difficult to see how the rate even booked through expedia can be fully justified with little luxury or whoa factor on show presumably it just comes down to the location as there very little else other than a sheratonin the immediate area so if you are visiting the areas above the argonaut has to be your choice if not i wouldnt be rushing to make a booking,tripadvisor
761,weve been to san fran many times over the years and the argonaut is by far the nicest most comfortable and convenient place weve stayed the nautical theme decor was delightful the room was spotlessly clean and all the staff we interacted with were terrific highly recommended,tripadvisor
762,we really enjoyed our time at the argonaut the location is perfect with its breathtaking views the hotel is clean and comfortable their staff is what made it spectacular we are not fancy or wealthy but their staff made us feel like vip guests,tripadvisor
763,the nautical theme throughout the hotel is fun and pleasing to the eye off of the luxurios lobby is a hall type room with pictures and interesting information of the history of the building in which the argonaut is in right across the street is the bay and just up the street in walking distance is pier 39 and the sf aquarium the staff are very friendly and knowledgable about the area and current events,tripadvisor
764,the argonaut hotel is a rustic form of elegance in the frame of the old cannery area the noble house people have created a truly elegant and beautiful hotel experience the rooms are spacious and well appointed the staff is caring and attentive to every detail room service is exceptional only parking is an expensive hassle but we have learned how to travel san fran without renting a car walk a lot uber some public transportation and stay at the argonaut,tripadvisor
765,we loved the location right at fishermans wharf the cable car turn around is across the street many cool restaurants within walking distance good restaurant downstairs we were pleased the service was excellent and the rooms were clean,tripadvisor
766,this hotel was lovely and very well managed they accommodated our early checkin to make our visit to san francisco enjoyable we enjoyed the easy of walking to local restaurants wharf amenities and the alcatraz ferry,tripadvisor
767,had a wonderful stay and would definitely recommend to family and friends the location cannot be beat the restaurant was very good the concierges were most helpful the guys out front are an asset as they are so welcoming and helpful,tripadvisor
768,excelent hotel acomodations locations i recomend u to rent a bike and enjoy san francisco also the restaurante of the hotel was really good ruben and marcus were really kind i hope u enjoy as us,tripadvisor
769,stayed with my family for 2 nights in november 2021 rooms were comfortable my really late checkin was smooth the bellboy offered complimentary new masks hotel offers parking breakfast was nice convenient location at fishermans wharf a stones throw from ghirardelli square a cable car station bike rentals the cannery mall and various car rental companies would recommend this for families who want to be close to the wharf area or want to enjoy a beautiful golden gate view without breaking the bank,tripadvisor
770,we arrived dropped our luggage and rushed off to make a planned visit to alcatraz but on return to check in our baggage was missing after some advice and suggestions from us they found the luggage and offered us compensation after some negotiation which was fine having stayed at a noble house resort in key west our expectations were high but fell short of the same experience hotel is good but nothing special to match the high price for half the price you can go one or two blocks back to other chain hotels which i am sure would be more or less the same as the argonaut the bar shuts early last orders at 10 and terrace heating switched off then also which was not too great for 2 couples on vacation parking expensive with a car park one block back half the price overall disappointed with value for money as there was nothing special about the service or hotel,tripadvisor
771,spacious rooms thoughtful and attentive staff the location is superb especially for explorers the maritime museum is directly adjacent hyde street pier is right across the street as is the cable car and ghirardelli square be sure to try the blue mermaid restaurant on site the service is friendly and allpro the food is fresh and delicious it is one of the most pleasant and convenient hotel stays for sightseeing in sf the lobby is inviting and particularly wellsuited to hanging out on a classic sf foggy day as the fireplace is cozy there are a number of games available to check out at the front desk and if you have kids be sure to ask about the wellthought out scavenger hunt prize at the end if you want everything at your fingertips and a comfortable stay while in sfthis is your place,tripadvisor
772,thoroughly enjoyed this hotel we had a room overlooking the bay great views all staff within the hotel were amazing room lovely and clean bed was very comfortable recommend bay views room was quiet considering how busy it is outside pillows were good too,tripadvisor
773,great location excellent service and very clean walking distance to pier 39 ghirdelli shops and restaurants its my 2nd time and we really enjoyed our stay will surely come back again highly recommended,tripadvisor
774,i was supposed to meet a friend in san fran but it fell through so i was solo for a week but had a great time friendly staff and people great bars and restaurants in and around the wharf perfect location for experiencing the city i really enjoyed my stay,tripadvisor
775,do not got to the restaurant of the hotel service is not good and choice limited fitness center clean decoration of hotel rooms lobby is nice location is perfect to visit most of the city easy to take the cable car nearby,tripadvisor
776,the argonaut is great for a tourist trip to sf many areas within walking distance the rooms are regular size set up similar to most standard hotels long and narrow not a true boutique hotel more of a themed family hotel hotel seems to be on the senior motor coach route i was expecting a more polished boutique all that said service was good and room was clean,tripadvisor
777,we spent 4 nights at the argonaut apart from a good 15 minute wait to check in everything was pleasant about our stay nice large comfortable room that was very quite we were at the back of the hotel there is a coffee machine in the room but being english we like a cup of tea when we wake up no problem dial down and the bring you a pot of hot water no charge breakfast in the blue mermaid was very substantial you didnt need lunch the location was about a 10 minute walk from pier 39 and about 15 to 20 minutes from the pier that goes to alcatraz a couple of streets away was the first stop for the hop on and hop off city bus tours,tripadvisor
778,i only stayed for one night but i wish i could have stayed longer location is perfect walking distance to fishermans wharf pier 39 and ghirardelli square also right next to trolley stop so you can get around the whole city hotel is very cute and modern inside decorated like a nautical ship theme throughout staff was very friendly and welcoming,tripadvisor
779,loved this hotel from the location the decoration the comfy bed to the great food in its connecting restaurant lovely friendly staff especially the concierge who book just about everything for you this hotel is really up to date even having usb ports in the bedrooms instead of you taking loads of adapters brilliant,tripadvisor
780,we wanted to stay close to fishermans wharf and this was the ideal location we upgraded to a bay view room and everything was great downsides would be a room on the park side of the hotel through a weekend revelers enjoyed the bars well into early morning 3am hours so sleep was interrupted the only other thing was during our stay the bar and restaurant were closed for renovations but with plenty of choices in the area this wasnt a problem,tripadvisor
781,this hotel is located in an excellent location for exploring the fishermans wharf area with pier 39 roughly minutes leisurely walk away lombard street is a 15 minute very steep walk away we stayed during fleet week so the whole area including the hotel was very busy but this didnt phase the staff at all rooms are large and spacious and like the rest of the hotel of a nautical theme beds are comfortable and surprisingly high of the ground no sensor mini bar and fridge which makes a nice change fridge even has enough space to keep your own food and drink in it the restaurant attached to hotel also serves some really good food as well as showing sports only negative is there is only two lifts which can result in fairly long waits when busy even though there are only 4 floors in nutshell we had a great stay and would happily stay again,tripadvisor
782,a stylish interior with a rustic bar restaurant which was comfortable and relaxing the rooms were huge and bed very comfortable the staff were very friendly and niothing to much the hotel is situated in a superb position to pier 39 a must stay say hello to the front of desk people and the bell boys treated us like royalty,tripadvisor
783,pleasant hotel and nice restaurant my hair syler went missing from room and staff more or less took no actionthis was a disappointing responsespacious rooms and well equipped good quality room and well serviced,tripadvisor
784,i have so many wonderful things to say about the argonaut i stayed at this hotel for 6 nights on business and i went away with a truly positive experience years back i saw the argonaut while on another trip to san francisco and i always wanted to stay there something about it just caught my eye so when i saw that it had a rate my employer would cover on my recent business trip i was ready i tell this tale because i went to the argonaut with high hopes and they did not let me down i was not in an upgraded room with a view but my room was terrific it was meticulously clean wellappointed and very comfortable my king sized bed offered me a great sleep the only downer is that the walls did seem a bit thin and i could hear the neighbors if it was totally silent fortunately for me i need to sleep with a fan or white noise of some type so it was no issue the staff was also really friendly and accommodating i wish i could remember everyone that impressed me but i remember john frank matthew and peter as providing excellent service best of all you cannot beat this location fishermans wharf is a wonderful location for tourists and it was just across the street from a beautiful public park the terminus of one of the cable car lines and ghirardelli square there was a huge selection of restaurants nearby a starbucks around the corner but you do have a coffee maker in your room and there were several bus lines within easy walking distance to get all around the city i have stayed in a lot of locations in san francisco but this was hands down my favorite,tripadvisor
785,this place is a great place the location is so convenient right at fishermans wharf you just walk up the hill to the end of the trolley line you are also just a few blocks from ghiradelli square the staff was so efficient and the space in our room was so comfortable we were on the fourth floor with a nice view of the park beside us even though you are in a really busy part of the city i feel like our room was pretty quiet we did hear the bridge horn some in the night check in and check out was so smooth would definitely stay there again,tripadvisor
786,the hotel has a very nice feel with it being in an old building the staff are warm and helpful and the doorman greeting you everyday was a nice thing to start the day off with the location is brilliant as it is just around the corner from a cable car main station uber drivers find the location with ease beds were very very comfortable and thats coming from a picky person food wasnt the best and so we ate out every night bar one overall its a great place to stay when youre visiting san francisco,tripadvisor
787,kudos to the argonaut and its entire staff we stayed here on a two day whirlwind tour of san francisco with our daughter who arranged the trip the hotel is located on jefferson street and is conveniently located to fishermans wharf it is easy walking distance to pier 39 the alcatraz ferry ghirardelli square cable car terminus not to mention the many restaurants and shops the argonaut is a nautical themed hotel with a bar restaurant comfy rooms and a complimentary happy hour from 46 for registered guests during weekdays our room had a small window that looked out to a park and the bath very acceptable we would recommend this hotel and stay again the valet parking fee was high at 50 plus tax for each night thus the reason for the 4 star,tripadvisor
788,we loved this hotel room was the smallest we had stayed in during our trip around california but the is quiet and comfortable loved all the decor and steven the bellhop gave us an unforgettable welcome we didnt particularly like fishermans wharf too commercial but it is vey handy for alcatraz and getting the trolleys and bike tours,tripadvisor
789,this is how strongly i feel i need to review this hotel im not even home im the passenger in the car driving on the motorway back to birmingham but need to express how absolutely stunning and special this hotel is right from the moment you enter the hotel you are made to feel like royalty staff are polite and knowledgeable the room was another level huge bed and im so glad i choose to book the bay view king room as our view was over hyde pier and alcatraz as this was a special trip for my boyfriends 30th i did send a quick email to the hotel asking for a fab view only if possible and my god did they deliver not only that we also revived a hand written note and a bottle of wine for his birthday what fabulous service the location was perfect close enough that everything was within a 510min walk 5min pier 39 10min pier 33 for alcatraz pick up the shops were delightful tram station was half a block away and the hop on hop off bus was also 1 block away we did the 3 day your including muir woods must do day trip also a couple of doors down from the hotel is bike rental which was lovely we went along the marina sandy beach and to the golden gate bridge i have no doubt in my mind that we will return to san francisco and would stay no where else but at the argonaut,tripadvisor
790,if your travel goals include being treated like royalty book a stay at the argonaut hotel from the moment of arrival to the sad moment of departure you will feel beyond special waking up every day to a water view which included alcatraz the bay and the bay bridge really connected me to the city plus a sailboat regatta of over 100 boats on a saturday morning is hard to beat,tripadvisor
791,this was our second visit to san francisco and we chose this hotel because of its location and views we werent disappointed hotel was very clean and the room was spacious and very comfortable very nice roomy lounge area by reception restaurant offer was a bit limited but there are many others to choose from so this wasnt a problem one of us was glutenfree so can highly recommend the beach street grill for a great breakfast just a short walk away,tripadvisor
792,the argonaut is located in fishermans wharf but away from the busier tourist area the room was very clean comfortable and nicely decorated the hotel is conveniently located we will definitely stay here again when traveling to san francisco,tripadvisor
793,i stayed here in september 2015 whilst i liked the exterior of the hotel and the entrance arealounge i felt it was very expensive for the room standard the standard rooms overlook not sure that is the right word straight onto the rooms opposite an interior inaccessible courtyard it was kind of like a square prison and if you didnt position the window blinds at the right angle you can see straight into the rooms opposite that said the room was nice and comfortable and clean and i liked the leopard print bathrobes we were in a room which was next to an electrical cupboard of some sort and this made quite a dinit didnt bother us too much but may bother some people we liked the location and the staff were very nice but im not sure id stay here again,tripadvisor
794,we enjoyed our stay at the argonaut the staff was friendly and helpful and the rooms clean and quiet the bed was comfortable but the chairslounge not so much the location was perfect walking distance from fishermans wharf for the money ti was a bit pricy,tripadvisor
795,this is a nice hotel in a great location the room is at small by american standards very long and narrow i guess this is a function of the conversion of an existing building but nicely decorated and mine did have a view of the bridge i feel it is overpriced and very much trading on the location the soundproofing is ok you can hear other people,tripadvisor
796,we spent a long weekend in san francisco and from prior stays in the area we knew we wanted to stay here and we were not disappointed two staff members that truly understand service are troy and donovan what a pleasure to be welcomed to the hotel by these gentlemen our room was not ready when we arrived did not expect it to be since we got there off an early flight into sfothey stored our bags and helped us rent bikes from the firm down the street the hotel itself is quite nice and the location is central to everything in the area we would stay here again,tripadvisor
797,just spent a great few days at this hotel rooms were lovely bed huge comfy staff friendly helpful the blue mermaid restaurant bar was great for food drinks in the evening especially after a day of walking would definitely recommend it,tripadvisor
798,stayed there during the rsa conference its far away from the moscone center but you are at the terminus of the cable car sole problem of cable car is departure is a bit random the hotel itself is really beautiful rooms are very large went for the king deluxe bed was perfect and i really loved the deco when you enter the room a nice welcome pack will be waiting for you it does give a nice feeling considering that i was in center most of the day i didnt had much chance to try the breakfast buffet so i cant review it but for the rest all was perfect,tripadvisor
799,we were looking for a hotel that was well placed to enjoy san francisco without renting a car and wanted something fairly nice as we were staying several days this location was amazing in between ghirardelli square and the wharf on a safe fun corner right beside the end of the cable car route the staff were all extremely friendly and helpful both before our trip communicating with me via email as we planned the trip and while we were staying there the room wasnt huge but given the location it was roomier than i expected and the decor was clean fun maritime themed and the whole facility was welcoming and pleasant highly recommend,tripadvisor
800,we are staying here at the moment and must say its a lovely hotel the staff are really friendly and helpful and the room is fantastic very clean a good size and well maintained the room is serviced daily if requested would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in san francisco fisherman wharf area,tripadvisor
801,this hotel located in the fishermans wharf is nicely decorated reminding of ships and nautical experiences this goes from the lobby all the way to your room the staff is very friendly and do make good suggestions the attached restaurant also has a lot to offer with respect to seafood and chowders walking in the surroundings makes you feel like the european and american styles do converge in that area,tripadvisor
802,the best thing about this hotel is the location down by the water within minutes you have a view of the golden gate bridge access to the cable cars or fishermans wharf and lots of amenities nice theming throughout the whole of the hotel with the nautical touches and we were always warmly welcomed through the door didnt rate it 5 stars as in our room there was usually lots of corridor noise the lighting in the room wasnt great on an evening just lots of lamps that you have to go round turning onoff and i didnt find it to be all that particularly comfortable overall we had a great stay and so dont take my review too negatively but to say what we had paid and the added value which is charged for plus the 100 per night holding charge all these things put a little less shine on the stay here,tripadvisor
803,your facility is outstanding your staff is very friendly and well trained in hospitality we vey much appreciated you holding our bags saturday afternoon after we checked out while we were waiting to catch the red eye at the airport,tripadvisor
804,excellent property cant say enough service was flawless and the beds are amazing i had such a great experience with the staff very helpful and great recommendations i will be telling everyone i know about this place,tripadvisor
805,absolutely loved that this hotel is a building with history and has been restored with this in mind staff very friendly and welcoming room was actually like the pictures very clean and comfortable facilities good main thing for us was the location as couldnt have been any better on a corner with cable cars bike hire and historical chocolate shop in one direction historical dock and beach area in the other fishamens wharf just down the road and if you are prepared to walk for a while can easliy do things like chinatown lombard street and the other docks,tripadvisor
806,best hotel by the water and friendly staff great dining experience at blue mermaid restaurant kids friendly hotel with lobby activities and gamesblue mermaid restaurant has an outstanding patio and seating,tripadvisor
807,my husband and i stayed here on our visit to san francisco we were greeted warmly by the bellhop when we first arrived checkin was a breeze and our room was ready early located at fishermans wharf and a block from ghirardelli square,tripadvisor
808,stayed at the hotel just before fleet week so it was very busy we were upgraded which was nice and the room was very comfortable with a street view we had asked for a quiet room but there was a constant fan noise in the room all night after we turned the air con off which we complained about we were told that it was the same in most of the other rooms nearby and after looking at moving to a smaller room we decided to put up with it however what surprised me is that the receptionist never asked if we managed to sleep etc not great customer service if you are staying there avoid room 306 or take ear plugs on a positive the hotel was well maintained and the staff were pleasant especially chloe who despite loosing her voice was very helpful,tripadvisor
809,the argonaut hotel is at fishermans wharf next door to the cable car terminus the restaurants and shops are right outside the door our room overlooked the golden gate bridge and the cable car turnaround our room was very comfortable and large we enjoyed the wine bar downstairs and the blue mermaid bar the staff at reception are helpful and welcoming a great memorable stay,tripadvisor
810,stayed here for four nights in early july 24 to celebrate my sons birthday and 4th july fishermans wharf is a great place to explore lots of shops ranging from touristy to decent goods there are also some excellent restaurants such as fog harbor the hotel was in a great central location and you could walk to many places from here we walked to the golden gate bridge a little over 35 miles which was tough going as it was a hot day but a lovely walk nonetheless the rooms are comfy and spacious facilities like the bar and fitness room are pretty good too food and drink prices are a bit on the high side but its decent quality all in all a very good stay,tripadvisor
811,we stay here every anniversary and have a great tome love the location i would say you should stay here they do make you feel special and that you do matter the only thing is they should smile when they answer the phone but in person they are terrific they always do a special touch for us when we go every time so i so appreciate it,tripadvisor
812,the room was huge clean and comfortable the bathrobes provided were fabulous i ordered one as a gift after i got home the location is perfect steps away from many attractions on fishermans wharf across the street from the cable cars close to lots of things the staff is very helpful and friendly,tripadvisor
813,what a gem located in the fishermans warf area of san francisco it is close enough to be close to the touristy ward but far enough to be peaceful and relaxing we stayed here during the fleet week which we had never heard about when we were making reservations in early october the front desk staff concierge are awesome so helpful and really went the extra mile to make sure we had a great trip all of the employees seemed to really like their coworkers and enjoy their jobs and it really shows and made a difference we stayed in a deluxe king room i was disappointed because the bayview rooms were sold out but was pleasantly surprised to find that after checking if any bayview rooms had come available during checkin my deluxe nonbay view room had a small view of the bay it was obstructed but i still got that view i was looking for the room was an average size and very clean bathrooms were very well equipped love the bigelow toiletries beds were comfy and came with a variety of pillows which i really appreciated lots of cool extras like yoga mats in the room and animalprint robes i wont lie the reason why i chose this hotel over a couple of others in the warf was it offered complimentary wine beer every night in the lobby judge me i dont care this is san francisco and everything is expensive the lobby was slightly cramped it was packed but everyone seemed to really be enjoying themselves and letting loose a little bit what a great way to meet other travelers i also thought it was pretty neat that no one was on their phones during the wine tastings for a society that is so plugged in it was nice seeing everyone interacting with people right in front of them not a screen we met some really interesting people this way and appreciated the lady serving the wine and her knowledge of the area this hotel loves pets it was cool seeing so many dogs in the hotel i didnt travel with my animals but from my understanding this is free the restaurant the blue mermaid has awesome clam chowder also get the mrs doubtfire recommended by my server its a delightful cocktail last but not least be sure to join the kimpton karma rewards program before you book your room this allows you to get free wifi for your entire stay as well as a free 10 bar credit or 10 minibar credit at all of their hotels for every stay although the hotel isnt centrally located in san fran i love the location it is very close to the powellhyde cable car and is in the quieter section of the fishermans warf also very close to ghiradelli square,tripadvisor
814,i stayed for 3 nights and the property met all expectations it is a high quality property with clean rooms and great service i would stay here again but be mindful that if you are going for business you will have to budget at least 15mins to get to the financial district or union square,tripadvisor
815,great room really nice hotel botique type great location facing the ocean next door to cable car roundtable well located for sightseeing view of the golden gate shopping great restaurants in walking distance close to giardelli chocolate store,tripadvisor
816,i have stayed here a total of 4 times and loved each and every stay the rooms are clean fresh sheets close to everything lovely and helpful staff the building itself is full of history and the museum near the front loby is amazing if your into maritime history i loved it worth the price,tripadvisor
817,i do not know why you charge an extra after i paid you all through expedia people at the front desk told me that with the extra payment they make me i can use bicecles but i do not like that also a motor bike but they anly had four and they were busy,tripadvisor
818,from the moment we walked through the doors we felt welcome the staff was professional and the property was top notch in quality and value you truly cant beat the location just steps from ghirardelli square and fishermans wharf its a great option if you dont want to have to rent a car highly recommend,tripadvisor
819,best location in sf in my opinion room was spacious with everything you need right on fishermans wharf a five minute walk to the end of the cable car line and within walking distance to pier 39 and pier 33 alcatraz the only reason this review is not getting five stars is the lack of a bar if you want a drink in the hotel you sit at the bar of the adjoining restaurant other than that a big thumbs up,tripadvisor
820,we stayed here for our last night in the city the room is spacious and very comfortable the staff is exceptional and always willing to please it was pouring down with rain and they gave us an umbrella to use while walking around they have a nice little happy hour each evening and at christmastime it was beautifully decorated the front desk and valet staff went out of their way to address all our needs its always a treat to stay here and they have the coolest robes to wear,tripadvisor
821,i spent 2 nights at the argonaut hotel at fishermans wharf in san francisco its an excellent hotel with en excellent very nice staff at a location which is hard to beat it has an excellent restaurant the mermaid the rooms are clean and the whole atmosphere is very nice i will come again,tripadvisor
822,this hotel is amazing and in a wonderful location on fishermans wharf from the moment you are greeted at the front door to the time you check out all the staff are so friendly helpful and eager to ensure your stay is enjoyable the rooms are well appointed and furnished with all the amenities needed they also have a wine happy hour for guests where you can enjoy a complimentary glass of wine and mingle with other guests it is also a pet friendly hotel which i loved having left my pets in australia i was able to pat the occasional well behaved pooch,tripadvisor
823,we just returned from a week long trip to san francisco we were fortunate to stay at two excellent hotels one of which was the argonaut there is much to like about this hotel its grand appearance the top flight staff the spacious rooms the fantastic lively lobby and helpful concierge and desk staff really great location if you want to take explore the golden gate bridge via bicycle its a short ride they also have urbe scooters for guests to use my kids loved tooling around the neighborhood on them the desk staff was also nice enough to hang onto our bags for an entire day after we checked out plus they let us hang around the lobby until our uber arrived both gestures were above what many hotels can muster rooms are a bit pricey but they are very wellappointed and super clean the only thing we didnt like has nothing to do with the hotel specifically but we stayed in the union square neighborhood for three days prior to our move down to the argonaut and found that neighborhood much more to our liking than fishermans wharf which is very kitschytacky beautiful harbor views from the argonaut alleviate the kitsch somewhat but venturing out can be a challenge despite that we would stay here again in a heartbeat well done to all at the argonaut,tripadvisor
824,hotel is great for the location and being able to walk to the areas surrounding the hotel fishermans wharf pier 39 etc stay is comfortable and rooms are immaculate staff is friendly and willing to help with anything you need in my opinion valet and parking were a little expensive but i understand parking is at a minimum in san fran so it is what it is try the in house restaurant amazing food and chowder,tripadvisor
825,slt21 thank you so much for taking time out of your day to give us a review the team is excited to had made your stay truly memorable the argonaut is in the middle of all local attractions on the waterfront ghirardelli square is a block away from the hotel the cable car turn is next to us both the aquatic park and hyde street pier is across the street when you are done site seeing stop by the blue mermaid for a cup of our award winning chowder or enjoy a glass of wine in front of a fire pit on our patio we hope to see you visit us again in the near future,tripadvisor
826,i loved the nautical theme hotel is in a great location near the peirs the chocolate company is right next to the hotel great resturant blue mermaid in hotel near public transit easily accessible by car,tripadvisor
827,good location bright and clean a bit impersonal i guess there are always people staying here for just a brief time they were polite but not keen to think outside the box it would have been nice to have milk provided with the teacoffee in room so when i went to ask for some at 745 this morning i was told that i had to wait until the restaurant opened at 8 the restaurant and bar close at 10 too no flexibility with small requests a bit intransigent we were 8 hours ahead mentally and it would have been nice to know that facilities like milk etc were available int he night should we have wanted them even better put it in the room there is a fridge after all the concierge was lovely when it came to making phone calls regarding our trips but i got the feeling that for the behindthedesk staff engaging the guests is not a high priority there is no drive for excellence which is a shame would i stay again yes probably forewarned is forearmed and i would plan accordingly but i would probably look for a friendlier place out of choice it felt just like having a nice bedroom and i was looking for a bit more than this,tripadvisor
828,our favorite place in san francisco away from the really crowded downtown area but easy to get to just about anywhere in town it is like staying at a destination resort right on the waterfront and a nice walk all the way down to the embarcadero district while enjoying all of the sites along the way what a great place great and very friendly staff and nice accommodations with a free evening wine bar a great lobby to meet and visit other guests and it is pet friendly we have taken our 95lbs goldendoodle wilson there many times he is quite a hit with folks the staff makes every effort to make our stay special and always enjoyable,tripadvisor
829,we had a comfortable and pretty bay view room looking out to alcatraz i wish we would have spent a little time in the lovely cozy lobby next time the location of the hotel is very convenient for a walk to the piers ghiradelli square and the turn about for the hyde powell trolley line every staff member that we encountered at the argonaut were pleasant helpful offering to answer questions and this really enhanced our stay highly recommend,tripadvisor
830,my son and i were 1st time visitors to sf and found this hotel to be the perfect option for us because of its proximity to the ggb pier 39 a major tourist hub and pier 33 where the alcatraz cruise departs the argonaut is the best option for those who need to be close to the main tourist attractions we rented bikes from blazing saddles around the corner and biked over and back the ggb we did a vantigo tour of sf in a vw bus which departed 2 blocks down the street snd we did dylans tour to muir woods with lunch is sausalito which departed from marina park again across the street we loved the convenience but we also appreciated the friendly staff supercomfy beds and linens plenty of drawer and closet space easytouse safe and spacious accommodations,tripadvisor
831,this looks like an organized fraud and you have to look at your credit card bill after checking out the employee at front desk suggested that we empty the mini bar everything was there in plain sight right next to the tvso that we can use the fridge before checking out we putted everything back in plus 2 extras beers that i did not drink check out went fine well guess what my crdit card was then charged for the entire mini bar 82us they finally reimbursed me other than thatit is clean but very very small rooms public parking 200 meters away for 40 day,tripadvisor
832,fabulous hotel and set the bar very high for the rest of our usa trip loved the nautical theme and rooms were fabulous the outside and of the building is very impressive too great location and staff were helpful and friendly,tripadvisor
833,i attended an international conference in san francisco in december and booked my accommodation very late i would usually have stayed much closer to the central business district or the convention centre eg intercontinental but all of these hotels were already full i was very impressed by the service at the argonaut from the time i arrived until i checked out five nights later the room had quite a quirky nautical theme and was decorated and furnished to a high quality with a really comfortable bed the exposed brickwork at one end of the room was an unusual feature and really suited the dcor the breakfast in the blue mermaid restaurant was average i only ate there on one morning the location is great if you want to be in the centre of the action at fishermans wharf in close proximity to the golden gate bridge alcatraz etc for business it is not quite so convenient i had a number of early morning meetings in other more central hotels eg le meridien and had to get a taxi there and back a small fare 10 usd which seemed to irritate the drivers i would consider staying at the argonaut again if i was travelling for leisure with my family but probably not when i return to san francisco on business due to it being a bit further out than i would like,tripadvisor
834,we stayed for 6 nights and it was wonderful it is an old factory turned into a hotel so it has that charm very clean room beds were very comfortable bathroom had a tubshower combo shower good water pressure one sink vanity but the top is very large so everyone has room for their toiletries towels were above average in plushness closet had lots of hangers and a safe night table had two drawers and dresser had two large drawers other area of dresser taken up by a dry and refrigerated mini bar in room coffee maker large tv on swivel with more channel offerings than most hotels ac worked really well housekeeping was very good doormen always good natured and eager to assist concierge arranged one day car rental for us for only 40 for the day nice lobby with board games to entertain the kids and some adults fantastic location right on the wharf with so many restaurants bars and shops just a short walk away buses and trolley right at the end of the block hotel has a bar and restaurant but we never drank or dined there for us it was a perfect place to stay,tripadvisor
835,really liked this hotel room was well done clean and had great touches and decor it was not cookie cutter and didnt feel like every other note staff is great overall location is good but does get busy on weekends with tourists out along jeffereson st and the end of the cable car line it was a bright spot in our trip to sf,tripadvisor
836,location cleanliness staff all great for being on the wharf i had some doubt on safety at night both nights we were out late tons of people and families still out homeless are there but they were more entertaining than anything singing dancing playing instruments if you have a pet the location was nice as its directly next door to the maritime park beach is right there along with ghiridelli square and the buena vista for some irish coffees lobby was comfortable to hang out in in the evening nice fireplace we brought our fur baby she was welcomed by all,tripadvisor
837,the staff are awesome at this hotel we stayed for a quick two night vacation for my husbands birthday staff were very polite and attentive they even left a package for my husband in the room we loved being able walk to fishermans wharf and were right next to ghirardelli square room was clean and the mini bar is stocked with awesome goodies just in case definitely will stay again,tripadvisor
838,we really liked the ambience of this hotel its location is perfect the room was clean and tidy this is a premium style hotel in a a good location so everything costs a bit more and the resort fee is a bone of contention the 10 a day voucher in the bar was the only bit used but we knew this prior to arrival and accepted it would of been nice to have a fridge in the room for personal use charging an extra 15 for an extra fridge is a cheek as the one supplied was for the mini bar the staff were always attentive friendly and very helpful just a note for other travellers when booking the hop on hop off bus take the two day option one day isnt enough,tripadvisor
839,we have been to san francisco several times but this was out first stay at the argonaut but it will definitely not be our last it is a lovely hotel in the ideal spot if you want to be in the fishermans wharf area the staff were tremendous we had asked for a room that overlooked the park and we were not disappointed the concierge service is brilliant and a little tip for you if you intend hiring bikes from blazing saddles a few doors down which we would also recommend the argonaut has 8 complimentary bike vouchers each day with them it is a first come first served basis in the morning but we got them both times we asked it isnt the cheapest hotel in the area but you get what you pay for we paid 400 a night for a room that gave us a view of where the cable cars turn round in the park which is what we wanted there can be a bit of noise early in the morning outside so if you like to sleep with your window open just be prepared to be woken up every now and again but it didnt stop us getting a good nights sleep,tripadvisor
840,good bits the location the view from our room of the bay and alcatraz the complimentary bottled water at reception bad bits not good value for money our suite was very expensive and the rest of the hotel did not live up to expectations service was non existent we took our own bags to our room no assistance was offered every time we tried to call guest services we got an ai bot that was utterly useless and infuriating the restaurant was average with surly service and very expensive our one and only experience with the concierge on our first morning was so poor we relied on google from there on in she ignored the questions we asked and tried to upsell us on things we werent interested in the one piece of info we did get out of her turned out to be incorrect the hotel is in a beautiful old building but alas feels soulless in the communal areas and there is no sense of a hub staff werent rude but neither were they friendly there was little proactivity there was a lot of chatting amongst themselves while guests stood around waiting for attention overall our stay was not terrible but neither was it great and for the money we spent it wasnt good value so we could not recommend it we were not asked about our stay at checkout i was send a satisfaction questionnaire after leaving which i filled out honestly but the hotel has not followed up about any of our feedback it just felt like they didnt care very much a real shame,tripadvisor
841,close to everything loved the location and surroundings great service by the valet and hotel staff wonderful food at the attached restaurant would have liked a bigger view of the marina window was small,tripadvisor
842,my husband and i arrived monday afternoon john and andreas were simply fantastic always willing to take the time to see how we were and helping with suggestions to any questions we had our room had a fantastic view and the champagne and happy honeymoon was such a grand touch loved this stay and will be really sad to say goodbye saturday morning and the rooms are cleanvery very important,tripadvisor
843,very comfortable rooms friendly staff great location in the heart of fishermans wharf there is a ben and jerrys two doors down which you get discount in staying in the argonaut hotel meaning it smells lovely as you walk back and you get to have lovely icecream every day the attached restaurant is expensive id recommend boudins for breakfast instead,tripadvisor
844,spent three nights here and it was a convenient spot for the family easy access to nice restaurants fast food and tourist attractions including a cable car stop next door staff were friendly and free happy hour was a nice treat,tripadvisor
845,overall a great experience with this hotel it is at the west end of jefferson street which is the hotspot at fishermans wharf you will be in walking distance of the piers bus tours and the cable cars many restaurants and other activities front desk was very helpful in arranging a car for our transport back to sfo bellmen housekeeping and all other staff were very pleasant and professional this was an excellent experience in san francisco,tripadvisor
846,arriving after a long flight from the uk we found the hotel easily and were welcomed into this lovely and friendly hotel we were originally given a room on the 4th floor 408 but there was a loud noise from some air conditioning units and immediately on requesting a different room was given one no questions no quibbles and very friendly explaining the noise issue these 4th floor rooms with noise are referenced in other reviews too hotel is a great location right next to the cable car terminus on the edge of fishermans wharf and also next to a park and beach so you arent in the middle of and taking ages to escape some of the worst excesses of the fishermans wharf tourist trap its also nice to see fishermans wharf early in the day when there are few tourists about our room 267 was large clean and beds very comfortable happy hour between 56 every night served complimentary wine and beer a great idea after our long days out in sf as a family of 4 we originally booked a double queen room with view for 3 days but then found that it was 200 cheaper for the same type room without a view the windows are quite small this was a good decisionand since we were out most of the day loads of other restuarants and breakfast places nearby so would recommend eating outside the hotel and you can ride the cable cars either earlier or later when its quieter valet parking whilst expensive was a breeze and be assured that is a godsend in sf all in all a great hotel great service great location would we stay there again definitely,tripadvisor
847,once youre inside it gets less frenetic than on the street but the decor is cheesy blue nautical on the whole a pretty good hotel nice wooden beams the little museum next door is delightful breakfast was ordinary and very expensive stay here if you want to be right in the thick of it,tripadvisor
848,ive stayed in many sf hotels and picked this one for the location for this trip although the rooms with supposed views had a glimpse of the bay at an angle in the distance front of house staff were friendly and concierge helpful no information on hotel or the city to be found in the rooms room itself was nice furnishings a bit shabby though bathroom very dated and small for the room size adjoining restaurant is ok but limited and not great choice overall the hotel was fine for what i had wanted but not sure id return,tripadvisor
849,we went here last minute due to a failed airbnb experience it was the last night of our honeymoon and so the woman checking us in very kindly upgraded us to a huge suite we were so pleased the suite was gorgeous with lots of nice touches like animal print robes and a big jacuzzi bath we didnt have much of a view but we werent too bothered about that seeing as we got the free upgrade the location is brilliant as you can just wander out the front door and within minutes you are at fishermans wharf and pier 39 with views to alcatraz and the golden gate bridge the hotel itself is actually quite funky and there are complimentary guest drinks beer and wine in the lobby each day at 530 we didnt eat in the restaurant so i cant comment on that however we did get breakfast room service which was quite pricey but nice for a treat the staff are what really make this hotel a great experience from the reception desk to the bell hop they all went out of their way to be super friendly and helpful,tripadvisor
850,we stayed here for a night between our international flights recently we arrived at 830 way before check in and the hotel were very accommodating in looking after our bags and going out of their way to get a room ready early for us gave us a free coffee voucher for the restaurant and arranged for a table for us to have some breakfast reception staff were very friendly giving great help on local transport and where to go they even called me when our room was ready later that morning room was very nice something different from the usual same old same old hotel rooms great to have an opening window for fresh air something that seems to be very unusual these days location is fantastic right next to the tram stop to get you into the city and union square right on fishermans wharf for all the attractions there completly different atmosphere to our earlier stay in sfo and much more enjoyable all round would recomend to anyone and will stay there again when we return,tripadvisor
851,my wife and i flew from los angeles for a weekend the museum was closed which really was disappointing the weather and hotel were fabulous great trip and all employees were helpful most restaurants and places were open the trolley cars were shut down still the embarcadero was not busy,tripadvisor
852,hotel is located at the hyde and powell turn around close to everything but most importantly its across from the buena vista and their fantastic irish coffees and breakfast besides walking along the embarcadero we walked the opposite direction to the marina district palace of fine arts crissy field ant the golden gate ferry to sausalito just a couple blocks skip scomas and blue mermaid terrible tadich grill gary danko fog city diner yummy,tripadvisor
853,we stayed here in march for a day trip to san francisico and we loved it the nautical theme is charming with the location pros called for an early checkin hotel was accommodating umbrella in room helpful for the rain great mini bar selection fabulous location near pier 39 quick uber ride to other parts of the city like the golden gate super helpful concierges great view from our room we could see alcatraz cons none we loved it here definitely would stay again,tripadvisor
854,excellent customer service staff are responsive and knowledgeable spouse is disabled and staff did everything extra to accommodate us the location of the hotel is exciting and scenic i was planning my next stay before even checking out,tripadvisor
855,100 will return to the argonaut my family of four visited the property and everything from arrival to departure was wonderful the bell staff jeremiah and jose was efficient and made arrival on the busy street so easy check in was welcoming and informative tzentin sorry if misspelled was wonderful at the front desk while i didnt speak with him in person ky helped me via phone twice which i appreciated very much jenmy at the restaurant was an all star my family loved the chowders especially the crab our room was clean spacious and we loved all of the subtle hints that we were in a ship port mirror star fish pillow etc the gym had really great machines i should also mention that our two dogs who traveled with us enjoyed their pet bed bowls and treats the location of the hotel right next to aquatic park was perfect for walks and seeing the sunset behind the golden gate the service that the argonaut provides is on point personable memorable after a few disappointing stays at different hotels it was so refreshing to receive such great service and a comfortable safe and clean room to come back to at night,tripadvisor
856,had a great time this hotel argonaut is excellent in a great place great room trendy bars and reception and very very friendly staff we really did enjoy the hotel and this lovely city 1010 for the hotel david,tripadvisor
857,the room was huge and very clean i have never been is such a cool hotel the staff was always happy to help with anything we needed my wife needed a spoon and bowl for her ice cream and the guy with the cool hat brought it up to her the museum was very cool the lounge area was nice to sit and relax before or after a meal at the blue mermaid over all it was an awesome experience,tripadvisor
858,recently stayed for 4 nights at this hotel with family and can honestly say great hotel and perfect location hotel service was good and standard and cleanliness of room perfect if staying in san fran and want to be on the wharf this is a perfect hotel,tripadvisor
859,really enjoyed our two night stay jeremiah was exceptionally welcoming and was a good man to have out front for those first second third impressions for what we wanted to do as tourists the location was perfect,tripadvisor
860,a wonderful stay in san francisco hotel personnel very friendly and responsif when you book a room state what kind of view you expect rather top than bottom floors were glad that we were able to change arrival dates at very short notice lots of wonderful restaurants just around the corner,tripadvisor
861,crazyinluv we greatly appreciate you taking the time to give us a review and giving us a perfect score the entire team is thrilled to had made your stay most enjoyable and memorable since the argonaut is in the middle of fishermans wharf this makes us an ideal location ghirardelli square is a block away hyde st pier is across the street the cable car turn is next to the hotel and pier 39 is just steps away as a added benefit staying with us we also offer two free hours limited availability bike rental from blazing saddle or if you prefer we have electric urbes 10 credit to use in the blue mermaid per a night and discounts with local business such as ben and jerrys and sees candy which is located behind the hotel please come visit us again shortly all the best keith hotel operations manager,tripadvisor
862,we came early to san francisco as we were on a tour that began here the hotel was very nice and the room adequate it is located right in the heart of all the activities so for us this was its best feature only its excessive price kept it from being a 5 star rating but most of the tourist attractions in this area are vastly overpriced so come prepared we asked for the room rate the tour secured but this was tactfully declined,tripadvisor
863,good receptionist and travel guide in hotel lobby good restaurant attached no noises although in busy area rooms spotless and kept so helpful polite staff at all times very happy to recommend cable car turn around right outside hotel buy day rider for best price,tripadvisor
864,we recently stayed at this hotel for 2 nights check in was super easy and the staff were really helpful the room was quiet big king size bed a small sofa and a desk the bathroom was pretty average but nice the tv had loads of channels and the mini bar was packed the location was perfect for us just a short walk to pier 39 or a very short drive to the alcatraz cruise dock was we really couldnt rate the location any higher shops and food right at the door step the blue mermaid restaurant downstairs was really nice too the lobby had plenty of seating and some games to play while youre waiting etc we also were given a free 2 hour bike rental with our booking from the shop next door so we got to see the golden gate nice and close we would definitely stay here again highly recommend,tripadvisor
865,be sure to know which way your room faces you can face the water a nice little courtyard or a lot of rooms simply face in on other rooms with no view at all except your fellow hotel guests the rooms are small but not uncomfortable and if you want to be in the touristy heart of fishermans wharf this is a good place,tripadvisor
866,we stayed here on my birthday while on the way to napa valley the hotels location is perfect being that its right on the waterfront i was traveling with my shiba inu and we had a wonderful time playing at aquatic park adjacent to the hotel there is nothing like a walk at sunrise along the waters edge with the golden gate bridge in the background long before the tourists flock the area we stayed in a beautiful very spacious corner suite with a hot tub i particularly appreciated the maritime theme of the hotel with its hardwood floors and exposed brick walls the building itself is a historic san francisco building the hotel staff was extremely friendly from valet to the front desk my dog was also welcomed by everyone whom we encountered i will gladly stay at this property again when traveling with my dog to san francisco ps parking is very steep at 50 a day and you dont need a car if youre just hanging out in the city,tripadvisor
867,you will definitely love the location and make sure to get a 4th floor room with a view of the bay or golden gate bridge the nautical decor and design of the hotel is great i love the cozy fireplace in the main lobby area with lounge chairs you can sit on during the chilly weather the hotel itself is clean and covid compliant the staff is very nice but can be a bit more engaging the rooms are very clean and made up nicely the bathroom is your basic tubshower combo and cloth curtain i do love the pocket door to the bathroom the sleep however was terrible their beds at least the room we stayed in was a spring mattress which you felt all of them on the thin mattress against the hard base board it was sitting on and made noise every toss and turn you will need to ask the front desk if you want a firmer memory foam pillow instead of the thin feather pillows we found that out on our last night the sleep is the only reason why we would not return but would definitely come back if they upgraded their beds,tripadvisor
868,this hotel by far is the best hotel for a stay in san francisco located near everything corinne provided exceptional customer service and is the sole reason i will be returning she goes above and beyond the rooms are exquisite and the blue mermaid was phenomenal do not hesitate and book this hotel,tripadvisor
869,if youre looking for a great holiday location right in the middle of the tourist trap around fishermans wharf then this is your place the nautical theme is everywhere and probably a great family option convenient access to waterfront and cable car into downtown lots of bike rental places nearby hard to escape the tourists so if you want something a little more chilled out you might want to look elsewhere,tripadvisor
870,i stayed with my family in a one bedroom bayview suite the bedroom was spacious and the living room had generous seating a table and chair for four a desk and still plenty of room for a rollaway bed the sofa also converted to a bed very roomy bathroom with nice toiletries and soft towels the room was not sound proof but the hustle and bustle outside calmed down considerably after dark so sleeping was fine calling it a bay view was a little generous as our view was of buildings that lined the bay but we were on the second floor and i suspect the higher floor probably have better views and the view was interesting so really no complaints there fishermans wharf was a little touristy but the hotel was on its edge and therefore quieter but still in close proximity to everything the location is great for public transportation right at the cable car turnaround a block from the bus stop and two blocks from the street car stop the afternoon happy hour was a nice touch and we got very helpful service from the concierge and front desk house keeping was excellent,tripadvisor
871,staff was very helpful when i asked help on a couple of issues great service from staff room was exceptionally nice and very clean i would stay here again also a very good location the stay also included parking which was great because it is a very busy area for nightclubs and restaurents and some museums,tripadvisor
872,great for any trip in and around sf very nice and safe area and also good for jogging swimming and bicycle tours the city is also within walking distance around 30 minutes breakfast can be eaten in the hotel restaurant if it must be glutenfree the kitchen will take special care,tripadvisor
873,we very much enjoyed our stay at this hotel recently the rooms were everything that was promised they were decorated in a nautical theme without being over the top we really liked the location right near the hyde street pier and hyde powell street car station the nightly wine reception was very enjoyable as we are able to meet many different people from around the world we met a very nice couple from oslo norway and now have a place to visit should we ever go to the scandinavian countries the staff are very friendly and helpful we spoke with the concierge on numerous occasions and received very good information and advice on the area we have stayed at kimpton hotels before and had very nice stays we would highly recommend the argonaut hotel for anyone looking to stay in the fishermans wharf area,tripadvisor
874,decided to stay here for 1 night as we were in transit very warm service nice spacious room with cute decor very apt maritime themed concierge was helpful in arranging for cab to airport for the following day would definitely recommend this place,tripadvisor
875,hotel rooms were nice however very noisy charges for items in room were not reasonable restaurant was terrific and employees were very nice the location was great and walking around was made simple,tripadvisor
876,arrived at the hotel after a long journey the checkin was easy quick painless we were quickly directed to the elevators and up to our room which we were told had a lovely view of the golden gate bridge even though it was not visible at that point the room was bigger than i had expected with the lovely quirky design features it was clean and well appointed it is in a good spot as a base exploring sanfrancisco although the wharf are gets very busy at times we loved sitting on muni pier and watching the sunset over gg bridge the common areas of the hotel are all well decorated clean recommended,tripadvisor
877,the best thing that the argonaut has going for it is the location between ghiradelli square and fishermans wharf its incredibly easy to walk to so many great tourist spots including pier 39 and pier 33 the lobby is lovely with a large fireplace comfy seating and games think upscale connect 4 and tic tac toe our room had a view of the the room across from the courtyard but we were really only there to sleep and we didnt mind also drinks at the fire pit outside at the blue mermaid was a great way to wind down now for the not so great the 25 daily urban resort fee is kind of ridiculous it covers wifi come on and infused water in the lobby which was empty every single time i passed through at least 6 times day next the bathrooms in the rooms are very dated and not laid out exceedingly well the hair dryer hangs on a hook just outside of the shower our shower head made a high pitched squealing noise that we couldnt stop no matter what we tried also prepare for long elevator waits with only 2 slow elevators finally perhaps the most frustrating was the service the representative at check in was flat out rude and also did not disclose the urban facility fee overall there were really great things about the argonaut but really annoying aspects brought the overall experience down great location and if you get a good deal its definitely worth it,tripadvisor
878,though the argonaut is in a touristy area its a great location if youre a runner or want to take advantage of daily bike rides to the golden gate bridge vouchers provided for free bikes first come first serve beautiful views with some challenging but doable uphills for your run or bike ride also the ferry building is a short bike ride away is a great place to go for breakfast or afternoon oysters we switched rooms upon arrival not wanting to face the street and the staff was very accommodating id stay there again,tripadvisor
879,i did not know exactly what to expect from the argonaut online pictures are often shot with misleading flattering lighting and angles this is a really nice clean unusual and well run hotel the decor is inventive as it is both retro and modern at the same time the rooms have a do not disturb make up my room switch and a doorbell great idea my only suggestions are better light blocking on the window treatments a way to divert the hvac vent and a larger mini fridge it was so full of their mini bar drinks that i had to remove them to chill my water bottle and dinner leftovers but thats nitpicking,tripadvisor
880,we stayed here for four nights end of may 2015 it is very conveniently located at fishermans wharf excellent and friendly staff very comfortable and clean roomscomlimentary wifiand free wine between 5 and 6 pm every evening we had a great time,tripadvisor
881,we stayed here with our 2 young children we had a room with 2 queen size beds before our arrival i emailed to ask if a portable cot could be provided the response i received was that our room package did not include a cot i was annoyed as i booked the room online directly with the hotel so the system knew i had young children travelling with us anyway i asked again on check in and the attitude then was very helpful and we did receive a cot there was a coffee machine but no kettle or tea making facilities which i found interesting also we werent advised of the facilities available to us until we checked out we didnt eat any meals here so i cant comment on that however the little snags did not ruin our stay the hotel is great and the location is superb we found the door staff in particular to be very friendly and helpful i do recommend it to families,tripadvisor
882,this is great place to stay on the slightly touristy fishermans wharf but on the edge and perfectly peaceful inside lovely fresh and clean feel to the rooms valet parking guys very efficient and helpful as you pull up out of the holiday traffic not cheap but would really recommend for a short stay in this wonderful city everything close by and you can wander away from the crowds quite easily as well as stroll along to the sea lions in the peace of the morning,tripadvisor
883,we had a very pleasant stay at this hotel the overall ambiance was cozy yet modern the nautical touches were stylish the hotel is very clean and the service was excellent a nice restaurant was on the premises the staff were very pleasant the location was excellent minutes from the beach and fishermans wharf,tripadvisor
884,this hotel is ideal for visiting fishermans wharf and also down town san fran as there is a tram stop 1 minutes walk from the hotel plenty of restaurants around the restaurant attached to the hotel is good but a bit pricey,tripadvisor
885,we stayed here for 3 nights for the first part of our honeymoon check in with travis was friendly and fast we got to our room and realised that it was not the deluxe view room that i had booked i called travis and after a few minutes he realised the mistake and we were moved to a lovely room with a view of the golden gate bridge and cable car turnaround i must all mention that in our original room there was some chocolate a bottle of sparkling wine and a card congratulating us on our marriage very thoughtful our stay was good although the hotel was very busy and noisy due to a hm convention one night we were woken around 2am by the room next door there seemed to be about 10 people in one room carrying on their party it took 3 calls to the front desk to get them silenced the hotel is in the best location and kept very clean and tidy we will consider the argonaut when we return to san francisco a note to the hotel when your guests book through a 3rd party please check their vouchers carefully this is what caused our room mix up and when we returned we also realised that we had a continental breakfast included in our rate but this was never mentioned which is a shame,tripadvisor
886,great hotel in the old cannery in the midst of fishermans wharf rooms are oversized and quiet we were celebrating our anniversary and were surprised by a beautiful welcome gift tray of snacks and wine,tripadvisor
887,we came to san francisco for 3 days with my two teenagers and this was the perfect place to stay super convenient location to everything the hotel was clean and very accessible close to the golden gate bridge trolleys lombard streeteverything for a tourist we would definitely stay here again,tripadvisor
888,we had a room on level 4 with a window overlooking the bay towards alcatraz whilst there is some street noise during the day and early evening we had no issues with sleep during our 5 days service from the staff is exceptional from the moment you pull up at the kerb the rooms are well appointed with everything a traveler needs very comfortable as the hotel is at the hyde st end of the wharf you are far enough away from the really busy tourist spots but only a 10 minute walk to pier 39 as well as a short walk to the hyde st trolley terminus which takes you right past lombard st it might look only 4 blocks away but the uphill walk is very very steep take the trolley and into the shopping district near union square the attached restaurant blue mermaid provides options all day with the breakfast menu a highlight offering full alacarte or just simple sides to make up a meal which was good value highly recommend staying here if you are visiting the sf area,tripadvisor
889,cozy room right at the end of fishermans wharf and next door to one of the trolley turn tables great location for walking everywhere room could have been a bit cleaner but i was only there for one night need to actually use the vacuum was there for a business meeting and they were very accommodating and sleeping was actually quiet considering i was on basementstreet level,tripadvisor
890,great location great service loved the room nice soft beds the door man was more than helpful when we needed a cab very quickly the bikes were so much fun the concierge was helpful and so kind to my teenage daughters they still talk about how well they were treated we walked to ghiradellis the cable car and wharf from the hotel,tripadvisor
891,location was perfect for exploring fishermans wharf staff was very friendly and helpful concierge and doormen had lots of excellent information and help maritime museum next door was excellent and is free a trolley stop is across the street along with a park next to the bay where we sat at night and listened to the waves excellent restaurant blue mermaid inside hotel hotel is at the west end of the area so is convenient yet very quiet room decor was fun and so was the doormans vintage navy uniform the fireplace in the lobby area was a welcome stop after a brisk night of sightseeing,tripadvisor
892,a wonderful hotel one of the best hotels ive ever stayed in small touches make all the difference to the hotel experience situated in a great location its quiet in the evening and felt safe walking around at night staff were helpful professional and friendly we are thinking of coming back to san fransisco and i honestly wouldnt want to stay anywhere else,tripadvisor
893,great spot to stay location is great to everything the hotel staff was great and gave recommendations to several spots this hotel was through a travel agent and was a great choice would stay here again if i can to san francisco,tripadvisor
894,the hotel is located in what was once the del monte cannery it was the first building built entirely of recycled brick from the 1906 san francisco earthquake the hotel has a nautical theme the rooms are not the largest i have ever stayed in but are big compared to some of the other hotels ive stayed at in san francisco the rooms are well decorated and equipped the location is super you are right on the street that parallels the bay right next door almost to ghirardelli square fishermans wharf is about a 10 to 15minute leisurely walk away the downside might be that it is quite an active area being so close to the bay and wharf besides the restaurant in the hotel restaurants abound within walking distance the turnaround for the hyde street cable car is less than a block away i would stay here again be warned this is not a budget hotel my rate was 341 + tax per night however it was not out of the range of other hotels in the area especially considering its location a car is not needed for the most part as all wharf attractions are within walking distance union square can be reached via the hyde street cable car less than a block away the tour i booked actually had a pickup from the hotel,tripadvisor
895,i met my bf in san francisco this hotel is beautiful the argonaut hotel is across the street from the fishermans warf it is near the cable car as well we used uber to navigate around sf you can also rent bikes if thats your thing the hotel is not a far ride from pier 39 a must see the pier larger than it looks the room was very clean and the staff were amazing marvin was a great help with answering questions we had about the area if youre a person who is fond of garlic i would suggest trying the stinking rose all of their dishes are made with garlic even the desserts within walking distance is scomas they had the freshest seafood that ive had in a long time thank u jean marc at scomas i will definitely be back to the argonaut hotel love love love san fran,tripadvisor
896,great location great service nice area to meet in the lobby to wait for friends or just hang before we all went back to our own rooms hotel was very helpful with securing tickets for sights that were sold out,tripadvisor
897,we stayed here as part of our honeymoon the room was nicely furnished and kept clean throughout our stay all the staff were friendly and helpful and couldnt have done enough for us we felt that the hotel is perfectly situated on the edge of fishermans wharf if thats where you want to stay we often went walking running or cycling in the mornings to golden gate bridge and didnt need to herd through the hustle and bustle of the tourist trap that is fishermans wharf the cable cars are right next to the hotel and so is ghirardellis the only things that we were disappointed with were the views there was none at all not even a street plus the noise the walls were paper thin where you could clearly here conversations next door not great on a busy weekend,tripadvisor
898,me and my girlfriend spent the weekend here for my birthday and had a wonderful time all the hotel staff were great most notably indy who was very knowledgeable and lead us to finding some amazing local views and food indy was a true professional with his jolly attitude making our stay very pleasant the beds were comfortable and the hotel was in a great convenient location that we felt safe walking around the views were spectacular and made for a memorable trip their blue mermaid restaurant is definitely worth a stop as well,tripadvisor
899,despite the fact that is ideally located the nautical decor of the rooms give you the coziness every tourist looks for i would definitely stay here again highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for walkable distance to the best attractions san francisco has to offer,tripadvisor
900,the only issue we had was with the air conditioning as soon as we let them know they sent someone right away to get it fixed by the time we came back from shopping it was running great there was never any question or issue with the staff,tripadvisor
901,the room was very spacious and inviting the tub was big enough for 2 and the hotel even included some bath bombs to try out with the spa jets it was an enjoying bath we had a room that over looked alcatraz and golden gate bridge we even saw some seagulls that perched on the building across from us we were minutes from exploring the pier and the chocolate factory overall a great experience,tripadvisor
902,the argon hotel is a great location to be in the middle of all the attractions of sf it is a short walk from pier 39 union square and a short cab to professional sports games the lobby man prince was precise and pleasant in helping us with our luggage and questions would return again,tripadvisor
903,i stayed at the argonaut with my family for two days and it was great the wharf was beautiful not too noisy and very touristy we were greeted by prince who took care of our luggage and explained how the hotel worked he was very nice spoke french for my parents to understand and had a very positive vibe he took us to our room and again was very sweet because of the service and the great rooms id love to come back to this hotel hopefully prince will still be there,tripadvisor
904,we thought this location was amazing close the fishermans wharf ghirardelli buena vista so much in close walking proximity we paid for the water view and were assigned to a room on the 2nd floor which didnt provide much of a view so we asked to be reassigned they happily accommodated our request honestly if youre not on a higher floor the water view price is not worth it in our first room we were able to see about an inch of the water the second room was much better we were very happy with our stay and would likely stay again,tripadvisor
905,the room was beautiful the people working there were all friendly from bell boys to front desk to maids etc and helpful we had a view of the golden gate bridge from our bay view room we needed a few additional items in our room like extra wine glasses robes and coffee cups and they were delivered in no time best of all the rooms was so quiet im a light sleeper so thats important no street noise once the windows were closed and very little hall noise you could barely hear the shower or toilet flush when someone was in the bathroom,tripadvisor
906,this hotel was recommended and booked by our local tagreat choicethe location was excellent and the room facilities were all we needed and morestaff were so friendly and helpfulwhen they heard we were on a trip for our golden wedding they gave us a small gift from the hotel i could recommend this hotel to anyone planning to visit the area,tripadvisor
907,very good location and a really nice comfortable room restaurant and bar were excellent we ate breakfast here twice and it was good with a good choice the ciopinno was excellent will definitely stay here again,tripadvisor
908,hotel is in great location right on the wharf we rented a car because we were also visiting family on the other side of the bay but id recommend against it as this is a very busy area with lots of pedestrians the location is in the heart of many attractions including ghirardelli lombard street boats to alcatraz and fishermens wharf i love the kimpton hotels for their quirkiness and this was no different appears to be original brickwork in rooms nice deep tub we rented a king suit and it was plenty big for two adults and child now for the negatives the room was oddly shaped and seemed to have a lot of wasted space it was more like one large l shaped room with the end of the l being nothing but the entry way and a small sitting table it was clean but looks like it is ready for a remodel shower door barely opened and closed needs new paint the restaurant food was not good and the restaurant looked like it needed to be cleaned my other issue was with the concierge we had not booked tickets to alcatraz but my daughter wanted to go i asked the concierge and was told to check back the next day and she may have tickets that morning she walked me down to a guy who i figured later was a ticket broker who sent me to another guy where i paid 90 per person for a bay cruise and alcatraz tickets separate tours but i had no choice the face value for each tour was 30 which i didnt realize until after i had paid so basically i had paid an 270 for tours 2 tours for 3 people i could have paid 180 for since the bay tours werent sold out and i could have gotten those at any time i was really paying double to go to alcatraz im not so bothered that i had to pay more than face value since it was my mistake in not booking in advance but did not like that the concierge did not explain to me ahead of time that she was taking me to a broker she simply told me to follow her as if she had some connection to get tickets had i known ahead of time i might have negotiated if negotiation was not an option the concierge should have explained to me the price ahead of time including that it was a markup and made the deal for me minor issue but it kind of bothered me in sum id recommend this hotel if you want to stay in this area but i wouldnt go out of my way to stay there,tripadvisor
909,great location close to pier 39 fishermans wharf and loads of restaurants what you would expect of a 4 star hotel clean and comfortable and staff friendly and helpful breakfast was good in the hotel restaurant there is a small museum part of the hotel which is worth a quick look and is free,tripadvisor
910,we loved the amiance as soon as we walked in charming great location if you are looking to stay in this area we had a fantastic water view we were offered our choice of a bridge or alcatraz view easy walk to pier 39 ghiradelli square and the buena vista for irish coffee the street cars and the cable cars they gave a credit in the restaraunt and shops the rooms were cute bathrooms very small and the walls were thin but those things are to be expected in a more historic building our only problem was that we couldnt get a luggage rack in the room to put the suitcase on i have some physical limitations at the moment and that was problematic but otherwise we really enjoyed our stay here,tripadvisor
911,heres to another great stay at the argonaut hotel we stayed here for 4 nights in a king suite which fit 5 adults comfortably both the bedroom with a king bed and the livingdining room area are spacious and clean there is a sofa bed in the living room and we requested two rollaway beds for our sons and nephew to sleep on the suite is exactly as described on the website the bathroom was large and had enough counter space to fit all our toiletries the staff from the bell desk valet front desk concierge and housekeeping were so friendly and helpful the hotel is conveniently located next to the cable car turnaround and aquatic park it is within walking distance to ghirardelli square and of course the many shops and eateries on fishermans wharf there is the blue mermaid restaurant in the hotel and we must say the service this time was consistently on point once again our stay was very pleasant and enjoyable will be back again,tripadvisor
912,good location for the bay and piers but some distance from main shopping areassites though these can be reached by adjacent cable car service of taxi uber staff helpful but a little distant comfortable well equipped room can be a little noisy around the hotel expensive food and services,tripadvisor
913,this hotel is perfectly situated for a visit to sfo it is at the quiet end of fishermans wharf next to and part of the national park service property the service is friendly helpful and accessible without being overbearing rooms are adequate in size and well and very comfortably furnished reading lights are good desk is comfortable and adequate to do work maritime themed decor is fresh and comfortable beds and pillows are great we didnt take advantage of it but dogs are welcome,tripadvisor
914,lovely stay at this very neatly appointed hotel decor is nautical theme they offer a cute plush toy sea lion on the beds when you arrive nicely located next to the starting point of the hyde line of cable cars that take you to lombard street and union square also at one end of all the shopping and restaurants near fishermans wharf good food at the restaurant but just across the street are more options and the maritime national historic park is adjacent,tripadvisor
915,we booked this hotel because it was within walking distance of a wedding venue we were attending we booked the argonaut suite and were pleasantly surprised at how large this suite was we had plenty of room for the two of us plus visitors the bathroom was massive there were a lot of windows giving as a 180 degree view of fishermans wharf and ghirardelli squaretrolley area we loved that the wc was behind its own door so that if someone want to utilize the rest of the bathroom while someone needed the wc both could be easily accommodated the shower and sunken tub were separate the tub had a wonderful view of fishermans wharf i just cannot say enough things about this property and its location we checked in around 11pm and it was breeze the front desk and bell desk personal were super friendly and inviting the hotel is conveniently located in fishermans wharf near ghirardelli square you can easily get on the tolley or muni to get around if you dont want to walk or catch a ride from our 5 days here we noticed that all of the staff were super friendly and accommodating should we need to stay in this part of san francisco again we will stay at this property the hotel decor is nautical theme with octopus tentacle wallpaper in the bathroom they even have deck chairs to lounge on in the lobby port holes near the elevators part of a boat in the lobby etc super cute,tripadvisor
916,just a fyi and this may be one you already know this hotel is right by the wharf and is in great walking distances of a lot of cool places and shops however it is very touristy and busy the early morning is the only time there isnt a crowd around this area the inside of the hotel is very nice customer service check in and check out wasnt the best but the nice gentleman that brought up our room service was very polite they hotel is very nice on the inside but we were able to hear our neighbors some we didnt have a view at all so if you want one even of the city make sure to book with a view the beds were very comfortable the bathroom was very nice too and i loved their soap it smelled wonderful they also have battery powered bikes that you can rent and its attached to part of the maritime museum all in all i liked this hotel,tripadvisor
917,we were here 3 nights on a hotwire deal it was a great price for the area i do feel that the cheaper rooms are given in the noisiest areas on friday night it was very loud outside due to crowds in fishermans wharf area thankfully i had earplugs the other two weekend nights were not as bad we were on 4th floor and could also still hear traffic noise beds were comfortable room very clean staff very helpful and efficient we had oversized pickup truck so daily parking was almost 70 with taxes we knew this going in so were not surprised but it does seem very excessive,tripadvisor
918,stayed at the argonaut hotel for the third time the location is outstanding the property is very well kept and the staff is very professional and friendly there is no better place to stay in the fishmans wharf area,tripadvisor
919,we book a standard room and when we came in our room i was very surprised the room is very big and nice there is mini bar which is ful 2 bottles of water for free free wifi stuff on reception are very nice and help always the position is close to the sea perfect u can find a lot of shops for tourists and a lot of restaurants also in the hotel there is a restaurant we didnt eat there but we saw menu and prices are good than behind hotel there is a starbucks where u can have breakfast or there is also breakfast in restaurant at 45 pm in lobby everybody drinking beer and wine nice atmosphere hotel is big room is nice just they have very strange bathrobe it was leopard and giraffe,tripadvisor
920,great location great service concierge was extremely helpful i am handicapped and have mobility issues she recommended tours that were easy for me the tour was amazing we saw things i never would have been able to see without her services close to cable cars too would definitely recommend and would definitely stay here again,tripadvisor
921,unique nautical hotel a great stay in sf near pier 39 however parking is 65 per night ugh we enjoyed the mermaid restaurant and the wine bar on site the staff was very helpful and it is walking distance to many great areas,tripadvisor
922,wonderful hotel near of all the attractions amazing restaurant and the rooms so comfortable pet friendly parking a bit expensive but worth it location is the best we will be back next year property manager was so nice too with an incident that we had,tripadvisor
923,perfect location near pier 39 and all the attractions staff very efficient they printed our boarding passes no problem room quirky and comfortable we would definitely stay here again when we return,tripadvisor
924,love this hotel it is in the perfect location close to the cable car pickup and right on the water staff is very friendly and always willing to help shoutout to the doorman who always asks if we need something great job team argonaut,tripadvisor
925,june 2024 celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary with some very special friends also celebrating 25th anniversary we chose the argonaut for its location close to fishermans wharf the hotel was lovely spacious and clean if a little on the expensive side but we found out that we had picked a time that coincided with a major event locally escape from alcatraz triathlon so the prices were much higher than at other times note to selfcheck for local events next time our room was great very spacious and clean breakfast wasnt included but a limited menu was available in their in house restaurant but we found it expensive blue mermaid ill do a separate review for the meals here we went hunting and out the back of the hotel was an amazing place called 8am brunch 5 minute walk away would go back to sf just for that the wharf itself was very clean and very well looked after but we felt it had a seaside town feel about it with so many souvenir shops there,tripadvisor
926,great location spacious rooms and friendly staff definitely recommend staying at this hotel blue mermaid food was delicious their breakfasts are the best i enjoy my stay and i look forward to coming back,tripadvisor
927,from a canning factory to an upscale hotel this hotel provides all the amenities anyone could ask for from the doorman in uniform to the special pillows on the bed this hotel is an example of turning something old into something new the rooms are large beds are comfortable and the bathrooms are modern the staff is friendly and efficient,tripadvisor
928,this is the place for the air show 4th of july or anything else you might want to do in the heart of the fishermans warf area we are from the bay area we come up to the argonaut once or twice a year and its always a perfect stay,tripadvisor
929,this property had great views and outstanding service nice touch to give a 10 credit for the restaurant splurge and get room with view of golden gate its well worth it they made it easy to add on wine for our arrival and even had a souvenir for purchase in the room my son loved his argonaut sea otter,tripadvisor
930,nice and cool place to spend time in san francisco near fishermans wharf the staff is very helpful in any situation even if they towed my car be careful and take care for colored marks on the street even if they are washed and look like from 100 years ago the high towing costs for my car peter compensated with a good rebate in the restaurant we highly appreciated this complementary gesture thank you peter,tripadvisor
931,very average hotel nothing extraordinary about it would probably never stay again unless it was discounted 50 off not having any type of breakfast service at all except from the restaurant attached was frustrating,tripadvisor
932,san fransisco is best experienced at fishermans wharf right next to historic cable cars is the equally historic unique and beautiful argonaut hotel the front desk and concierge are world class with amazing insight to activities and restaurants in the bay area and beyond staff are incredibly sincere and helpful they upgraded my room free of charge gave us free gifts to celebrate our engagement and even assisted in coordinating parts of it i would not stay anywhere else,tripadvisor
933,just stayed for a long weekend getaway and loved this place the location is great the building is beautiful and the staff was excellent everyone there was friendly and helpful sad to see the current state of fishermans wharf with all the closures but still a wonderful place to visit,tripadvisor
934,the hotel was perfect right next to the cable car and the wharf completely remodeled and clean staff was very friendly and efficient you can walk just about anywhere you need to go valet parking for your car and many restaurants and shops within walking distance we ate at fog harbor fish house and it was great for breakfast we went to caf 8am for breakfast and that was fabulous,tripadvisor
935,i am a fan of the kimpton hotel group and have stayed at other kimptons in sf and across the us i wanted to give the argonaut a try since the rooms looked visually appealing and the reviews were on par with my experiences at other kimptons overall i would actually say that our stay was disappointing for several reasons most on the part of the argonaut the rest on myself disappointing aspects in no specific order the staff i felt it was rather nonexistent aside from the gentlemen working the front door checkin was fine but not overly welcoming this was unusual for a kimpton checkout well even though we stood in line we waited longer since a person just sauntered up to ask questions and the the guest relations representative allowed this to happen my usually experience at a kimpton is you are often greeted warmly throughout your stay and there is a large staff presence in the hotel any other kimpton i have stayed at i would constantly see and be greeted by staff members at all hours of the day this was not the case here the wine hour was packed and seemed to be filled with people who knew about it but were actually not staying at the hotel in fact i often saw people walking away from the hotel with wine glasses this seems like a real liability issue i am not even sure there are people managing the wine hour there was no complimentary or tea or coffee service as you would find at other kimptons in the morning sure there was a coffee maker in the room but in the bathroom and that was uncomfortable at best they probably didnt want to deal with another round of people coming in for the free items logical but not really a kimpton experience the rooms the rooms are visually appealing and spacious but the beds were so hard that we barely slept in hindsight we wish we would have check out and tried another hotel because all of us 3 stayed in one room found we were in pain a week after traveling this is something another guest noted the beds in the double rooms are way too hard i actually prefer a firmer bed but these beds were so hard that one of us actually decided to try sleeping in the arm chair in the room they were that uncomfortable i cant convey how much this impacted our stay and the days after our stay i really felt awful and i am very sorry that i didnt saying anything about it at the time because i paid financially physically and mentally for it cleanliness the room was mostly clean but there were a lot of inconsistencies in the cleaning from day one to day two and three i also found it frustrating that the carpets were not vacuumed daily this seems like basic room service to me i felt there was a disconnect in this area that could be easily managed we left tips daily which were taken but the items we specifically requested more towels floor vacuumed were not provided the restaurant is terrible dont go there are much better places to eat in sf and i highly recommend that you by bypass it at all cost our breakfast was terrible the service was careless and lackadaisical our server actually told us he spaced out while taking our order the food was served cold without any condiments and it was expensive for what you get skip it the location this is my fault i wanted to try something different and get out of downtown but i felt this location was too much on the fringe of everything sure it was within walking distance to many things but they were not things i am that interested in if you want to stay on the wharf note that this is on the fringe of it not the heart of it if you dont want to be in a touristy location with the ding ding ding of the trolley nearby and the hoots and shouts of the duck boats then stay away from this location at all costs it will make you mad while not a big deal the hotel is also fully of families at all hours children were running up and down the halls there are also only two elevators and you often had to wait a short wait not a big deal to get to your room at all hours after thinking about it after the fact i would stay this stay was rather poor if i had to do it all over again i would really consider bringing it up the the management but i checked in on christmas day and i heard them tell someone inquiring about a room that they only had two left i knew it would be fruitless to complain about the beds when there was clearly no comparable room we could be moved to when we left the doorman asked us how our stay was and we mentioned the how terrible the beds were and his response was everyone says that its been a real problem and management is looking into it this actually made everything worse really you know this is a problem but youre just looking into it the really frustrating aspect is that its very hard to find many rooms in the sf area with two queen beds most of the rooms offer only two full beds while this is find for two people its challenging for three adults this was the main reason we selected this hotel because it was important for all of us to be together in the same room during the holidays i wouldnt stay again and i would suggest others look elsewhere when in the area there are many great hotels in sf its perhaps one of the most competitive hotel markets in any city ive traveled to and in dont sell yourself short make sure you select a hotel that really fits what you are looking for in regards to location comfort cleanliness friendliness price and room parameters its possible that this hotel will meet your needs but dont be fooled by all of the positive praise it has received it was just okay,tripadvisor
936,great location if you like the wharf area and we had a suite was very nice lots of room very well decorated and modern lessons learned however when we checked in we had a bay view room had an early check in which was great but there was a street musician playing right outside our room which was loud and we all agree needed to move us hotel did so promptly the problem began that night with the people above us for almost two hour straight there was a continuous thumping or stomping noise i called the front desk and they indicated they would contact them next morning at 730 it began again this went on for two more nights and two mornings i probably called the front desk 6 more times and they continued to apologize and try to get the people to stop i also thought the person above us was checking out sooner lessons learned we probably should have moved the first day secondly i would have liked the hotel to have been more aggressive in some way with the people above and lastly people who are that inconsiderate to other people in hotels should learn that we are all sharing some space here and to be more considerate of others the hotel did offer a small compensation which i really didnt care because it was more important to us to enjoy the very nice suite we had reserved 6 months ago anyway just words of advice if you have issues get them resolved immediately and to what you want,tripadvisor
937,nice big rooms and very comfy beds given its location you get very little noise from the street fishermans wharf is the touristy side of sf theres plenty other places to enjoy to be honest however for the area this is the best in the vicinity,tripadvisor
938,this hotel was recommended by our travel agent so we chose it the location is excellent with stunning views of the bay the bridge and alcatraz the staff were welcoming and friendly and we checked in no problem the room was larger than average with a lovely decor and thats all the good no free water in the room 8 for 1l i didnt even look at the prices for the chocolate and spirits the bathroom was quite small and the shower not the best although the toiletries were nice and plentiful there were children in the room next door and we could hear every cry and howl until they dropped off to sleep so the walls seemed paper thin fortunately they checked out the following day so we had quiet nights the rest of our stay on checking in we had had a long day so decided to eat in the adjoining restaurant blue mermaid a nice building a small menu with a special of a turkish starter main course i was told the chef was turkish so was looking forward to my kebab what a disappointment it was awful one thin pitta bread with some tzatziki and a relish and a plain kebab plonked on the bread no salad no chips no side i shouldve taken a photo it just looked like something you find in a toilet im british so very rarely complain but i refused to eat it and sent it back i was offered an alternative but declined we tried breakfast my wife likes her tea in the morning she was offered jasmine earl grey and camomile no breakfast tea no mint the food was ok but with better places within a 5 min walk i wouldnt choose here checkout was midday an extra 100 to keep the room til 1500 after that full room rate no room to freshen up change and with a night flight this was a little disheartening to park your car was 60 but if you planned on using it would cost an extra 10 a lot of places had similar charges not just this hotel would i recommend this hotel 6040 yes but definitely eat out and sort out your own parking nearby,tripadvisor
939,we had a wonderful experience at the argonaut you could say they went a little overboard with the nautical theme however the furnishings and decor were upscale and they pulled it off the staff was courteous efficient and handled several outoftheordinary issues promptly only one of which was hoteloriented we were given a complimentary upgrade the rooms are spacious and the bedding is extremely comfortable as a matter of fact im getting ready to buy a new mattress and id like to know the brand the argonaut has the lounge area is huge with plenty of seating areas the coziest of which is next to the fireplace the patio is a great place to hang out the heaters and fire providing plenty of warmth on chilly windy days while i hadnt planned on staying in a touristy area we opted for fishermans wharf because we didnt want to rent a car but i have to say for being on the main drag youd never know it once you are inside,tripadvisor
940,we stayed in the argonaut for 2 nights in june the hotel itself is in a beautiful waterfront location at fishermans wharf with every sort of restaurant you could possibly want within walking distance the room was lovely with a nautical theme and we especially enjoyed the animal print bathrobes in room facilities were above average filter coffee minibar exclusive complimentary toiletries usb charging points in room safe cordless telephone large flat scren tv the list goes on,tripadvisor
941,stayed at this hotel on the first leg of our honeymoon and really enjoyed it it was nice and clean when we arrived and we had the end room on the top floor which meant we have a view of golden gate bridge the room layout was slightly narrow but not a deal breaker i found it interesting that they actively welcome pets namely dogs to the hotel by greeting them with the little sign and free dog treats i found out on a tour that the city loves dogs and caters for them in their hotels location was great for easy access to the many eateries on the wharf the only thing i feel that the hotel is missing is a bar area also we had to call down to reception to ask the cleaners to clean our room despite them being near our room from early on,tripadvisor
942,i highly suggest the argonaut hotel it has many unique architectural feathers and is very well kept and the staff is friendly and accommodating the location is perfect right across the street from starbucks,tripadvisor
943,family of four with teenage kids stayed in a corner suite 345 beautiful room views of bridge and alcatraz right in the heart of the action 3 mins walk to fisher mans wharf right outside bottom of cable car bike to bridge and ghiradellis ice cream could not recommend this hotel and room highly enough if you are looking to visit sf as tourists,tripadvisor
944,this was my first visit to argonaut with our office in ghe presidio there really arent any great options nearby so i end up in fishermans wharf usually argonaut is fully booked i must have now tried at least 4 different hotels in the neighborhood and argonaut is nicer with its brick walls and more authentic feel to it,tripadvisor
945,beautiful hotel built in a historical building with excellent service close to pier 39 shops and restaurants we had a nice large king room with a street side view of the waterfront and alcatraz the room was beautifully decorated and quiet parking can be hard to find in the area but using their valet parking was great and we just walked from there or used the trolley service,tripadvisor
946,my husband and i stayed at the argonaut for the first time a few weeks ago location perfect buena vista just up the block ghirardelli square one block away beautiful aquatic park across the street view of golden gate bridge located right at the waters edge at fishermans wharf upper west end the restaurant in the argonaut hotel is wonderful food very fresh and excellent service from beginning to end from stepping out of the taxi from the airport being greeted by john who walked us in with our bags he walked us all the way to the front desk to make sure we were taken care of we felt special then we met eddie lopez at the front desk what an incredible worker he is truly committed to his job handling a busy front desk with ease and with such a great customer service attitude we felt so special he made us feel so welcome we stayed for 5 nights every day we checked in with him he would offer suggestions on where to go etc i have never met a more committed and happy worker i highly recommend the argonaut hotel the room was spotless and modern updated the maid service was excellent as well maid staff very friendly and hard working it just seems like all staff really enjoy their position are 100 committed to a great guest experience the location is the best walking distance to cable car right just up the block we cant wait to return,tripadvisor
947,team is amazing making my stay very special its location is at the quieter end of fishermans wharf the location is perfect for any activity restaurants and the cable cars simply fantastic i would highly recommend this hotel for anyone,tripadvisor
948,we enjoyed very much our stay in the argonaut hotel in san francisco besides the confortable room the excellent position and the delicious cuisine we really appreciated the kindness and the precious advise and help of concierge joana which allowed us to fully enjoy our discovery of san francisco thanks beppe and lilli mazzoni,tripadvisor
949,stunning hotel in a fantastic location fishermans wharf to the right and the hydepowell cable car and ghirardelli chocolate factory to the left staff were friendly and helpful free bike hire to cycle the bay and bridge cant sing the praises enough,tripadvisor
950,we started at 2 hotels during our trip a work event was based at the other hotel if i had the choice i would have stayed at the argonaut the whole time the hotel is in a great spot at the end of fishermans wharf we paid for a bay view room and could see the bay and the golden gate bridge from our room since it is at the end of the wharf its a bit quieter while still being close enough to make everything readily accessible the cable car turntable is right next to the hotel though we didnt realise at first because we didnt hear a sound from it there are also some bicycle rentals just a few doors down id highly recommend grabbing a bike and cycling across the bridge you can get the ferry back to the wharf as for the rooms themselves ours looked very modern and the nautical theme continues throughout the entire hotel we had all the amenities we needed and the staff were all very helpful on leaving we told a member of staff that we were moving over to the grand hyatt for a work event thats a nice hotel very classy he replied in my opinion the argonaut is a much nicer and classier hotel there was not a piece of 70s style wooden panelling in sight and the staff were far more courteous at the argonaut if we come back to sf in future the argonaut will definitely be our first choice,tripadvisor
951,san francisco is a wonderful place to visit hotels in general are expensive so pick wisely so you are not too far away from the main attractions we chose the argonaut a 4 star hotel right on the fishermans wharf this is a perfect position ideal to walk the warf visit local restaurants or go to alcatraz or even jump on a tram we spent five nights at this wonderful hotel there is so much character to this hotel the rooms are of a good size and well furnished and a lovely well price restaurant a nice touch from the hotel was complimentary wine beer or soft drinks for an hour from 5pm another tip is to purchase an onoff bus ticket from the kiosk just along from the hotel negotiate the price definitely recommend this hotel,tripadvisor
952,the argonauts unique looks its bold almost cartoonish maritime theme and easy walker location lured me in for a 2 day solo stay while visiting old friends in sf my stay followed a trip with my husband to wine country so i was still basking in memory of other upscale hotels when i arrived at the argonaut in that light the argonaut selling itself as a luxury hotel at luxury hotel prices was a definite disappointment here is what i did and didnt like about this hotel the good 1 walking location if the crowds drive you mad turn away from fishermans wharf craziness and go left you can take a wonderful walk to the pier up into the marina and as far as you like towards golden gate bridge beautiful 2 fun theming i rather liked the brash decor and im sure it is thrilling for kids visiting with family although that giant boat wheel mirror directly facing the bed was a bit much particularly for a solitary traveler 3 housekeeping hotel and room were very clean when i left requests for certain items a replacement for the broken pen and a robe since one was missing they were delivered and staged nicely the bad 1 price i paid almost 1000 for 2 nights in a room that did not have a luxury setting or approach see below for more details my king deluxe was comfortable but rather shotgun in its narrowness and my only view was of a courtyard where folks drank talked and occasionally howled at the moon really all day and night i have paid far less for much better spaces in similarly desirable locations often a luxury hotel will make up a less than perfect room for you with extra benefits and service but that did not happen here 2 seals minibars and itty bitty bottles of booze show me a luxury hotel where you have to ask for a robe to be delivered how about a room with a small cute madeinchinafor15cents plush seal with argonaut stitched on the side left prominently on the bed and on closer examination with a price tag of 22 the mini bar list said only 14 what a bargain a large minibar that looked like the food concessions at a movie theater minus the helpful glass barrier was just as expensive i couldnt help but wonder how quickly the tab would ring up when a small child entered and grabbed the cute seal giant pack of mms cranberry banana chips etc i didnt have to wonder what an adult would think of the 26 bottles of bad wine i still had a free bottle one of two of good wine our cheaper healdsburg hotel had given us as a courtesy the night before just to be clear ive seen such seals and minibars before at other hotelsmotels but at a true luxury hotel this price point the seal is free to take home to your kid and so are the snacks if not the alcohol management really needs to think this one through set up a snack shack in the lobby if you need too but dont turn my room into a luxury tourista minimart 3 front desk service after exploring muir woods earlier in the day i arrived at checkin in clean jeans a tshirt and black anorak definitely not a street urchin but not direct from tiffanys either the clients in front of me were dressed in business attire and receiving prompt attentive service on my turn the blonde front desk lady looked me over gave me a one minute finger signal and spent 45 minutes answering the phone talking to a coworker and casting glances perhaps to see if the other agent or the totally unoccupied also watching concierge had welcomed andor taken me yet when that failed she handed me over to a new relatively untrained staffer without a further word perhaps if i had been dressed more nicely i would have gotten faster friendlier service or perhaps not either way this does not speak well for service first impressions or the hotel 4 not a driving location i mentioned walking as a benefit driving is much less so when one of my friends tried to pick me up from the hotel it was nigh impossible for her to get there and the parking rates when she did were extraordinary there are so many amazing things to do and see in san francisco frankly this hotel is a much pricer attraction than it is currently worth if you can get a room with a view guarantee maybe it would be better but make sure to tell them to hide the seal and candy bars from your kid first,tripadvisor
953,we were completely blown away by everything at this hotel including our view of alcatraz from out window the staff couldnt have been nicer champagne for my mums birthday and wine and a restaurant voucher after an error during check in the rooms were huge and beautifully decorated as were the common areas the location was very handy for the cable car and all of fishermans wharf,tripadvisor
954,they had some glitches the day we arrived because their computer system had crashed but otherwise a great pretty hotel right on fishermans wharf in an old brick building retrofitted with all new everything,tripadvisor
955,i stayed in the argonaut several times last year and most recently beginning of february 2019 san francisco is a difficult place to find good hotels eg if you compare to nyc or european hotels and in regards to the location size of rooms the argonaut is certainly one of the better ones considering the price unfortunately the service is poor although a returning customer the would not recognize me would ask to do all the paper work again and again if you come back to the hotel in the evenings you will find rubbish from roomservice in the halls and it will not change until the morning also security is not up to date located in a very busy tourist location you see many non residents entering the hotel during the day they can go up to the rooms as they is no security on elevators or video surveillance in the halls feels sometimes a bit scary,tripadvisor
956,beautiful location well designed and well appointed large roomsvery friendly efficient hospitable staffbrilliant base for exploring san franciscogood food and restaurant we hope to return from the uk thank you for helping to make our visit to san francisco so memorable,tripadvisor
957,a very contemporary yet nostalgic nauticalstyle hotel in a prime location in fishermans wharf near ghirardelli square the argonaut hotel is in a beautiful red brick building which looks like an old wharf warehouse this was our first stop on our coviddelayed honeymoon and it was a lovely hotel to start it off we were originally meant to be staying around union square but the quieter fishermans wharf location was perfect for us the initial impression was good the open fire in the lobby was inviting for such cool weather and receptionists and bell men were friendly and attentive we were upgraded to a room with 2 double beds the room was very spacious and had a great walkin closet i loved the plantation shutters and exposed beams and brickwork very classic in style the hotel acknowledged our honeymoon with a lovely card and bottle of californian red wine thank you so much we stayed here for 3 nights and it was a great stay the only sour note is that since leaving the hotel on 20th may our 300 incidentals charge still hasnt returned to my credit card it is showing as pending almost 4 weeks later the hotel has informed me that the hold had been lifted at checkout and that it was a likely problem with my bank we stayed at 5 hotels on this usa trip using the same card and this is the only one where weve encountered this problem this otherwise wouldve been a 5star review,tripadvisor
958,the argonaut will always have a spot in my heart its not a chain its a friendly local hotel that ahs the vibe of warmth and welcome that i seek i dont want a huge hotel where i am just a number and the argonaut is definitively a quality hotel the location is the best in the wharf staff are awesome food is great and well i always return there,tripadvisor
959,we stayed in this splendid hotel located in the fishermans wharf area for 3 nights by booking two double rooms and we had a very good time the staff is very professional and kind the red brick building which was historically a delmonte warehouse is truly charming and furnished in a nautical style the excellent location a few minutes walk from pier 39 but in the quietest and most decorous area service impeccable laundry and at normal prices expensive parking 65+tax and valet parking however all the car parks in the area are expensive around 50 a day but where you risk finding your car windows broken by thieves san francisco has become dangerous worth the money they ask for and i would stay here again,tripadvisor
960,what a way to celebrate my 50th birthday if you are going to stay in the fishermans wharf area then this hotel is a must we were very warmly greeted and the bedroom was tip top quite luxurious and very comgirtable we opened the blinds and had a perfect view of alcatraz island it couldnt be better the hotel is in a perfect location with cable car into town just round the corner or a nice walk to town as we did a few times the piers and other attractions are close by so never a dull moment no hesitation in recommending,tripadvisor
961,adorable boutique hotel right in the middle of the action of the wharf trolley pick up right outside so close to the action tourist traps restaurants very close by great mini coffeecroissant breakfast rooms are small but well appointed loved the decor and theme helpful staff,tripadvisor
962,you could not ask for a better location the accommodations are phenomenal and the staff very friendly if youre one who loves the usual big chain hotelsresorts this will not disappoint this is now our new goto when staying in san francisco,tripadvisor
963,friendly staffexcellent large room and facilties restaurant partly closed for renovation but plenty of restaurants nearby well placed for all transportferriestour buses etc and taxis plentiful and reasonably priced approx 4050 dollars to airport would also recommend a visit to ghiradellistwo blocks away a must for chocolate lovers and the restaurant mccormick schmicks overlooking the bay both within short walk from hotel trolley ride with terminus for union square around corner would recommend visit to alcatraz but would suggest prebooking essential due to popularity at least one month ahead to be sure of required date and time,tripadvisor
964,easy to get to pulled up outside to be told by the door men that we had to pay extra for them to park the car for us we explained that we had pre booked a deal which included the parking they were sceptical to start with but checked with reception whilst the car was unloaded and all was fine the desk staff were great and were very apologetic they sorted our room and made sure we knew where everything was the rooms are long and quite narrow but are perfect they are decorated really well and we immediately felt comfortable the facilities included a sofa fridge desk safe and hair dryer there is wifi included too all the staff were really helpful we walked from here to a wide selection of goodgreat restaurants the ferry to alcatraz and up the steep hill of hyde to lombard street beyond if you are driving i would definitely book the parking package as it is much cheaper and easier can not fault the facilities staff or location will definitely go back when in sf,tripadvisor
965,amazing view and great cleaning staff customer service from the front was less than great and didnt seem like management really care about discrepancies however the view the rooms and location were all absolutely amazing,tripadvisor
966,this nautical inspired hotel is a wonderful place to be by san franciscos fishermans wharf all the ships details throughout the halls and rooms the steel and the wood beams the sea glass by your room number the nautical beautiful plank floors and seaside concept carpeting the staff is fabulous and very helpful comfy cozy beds great shower and ambiance everywhere do not forget to visit the mermaid the museum right in the hotel the winery tasting room not to be missed lemon water in the lobby for you to enjoy i love the seasalt aroma in the air sit by a cozy fire during the day in a great plush velvet chair with brass nailhead detail and enjoy some delicious wine from next door wonderful hotel incredible service extremely knowledgeable and helpful five star service and atmosphere they even have a wii game in lobby to keep the younger ones occupied interesting concept,tripadvisor
967,after a whirlwind weekend on the west coast in sonoma with some good friends we needed a place to relax and recover before heading back east the argonaut hotel provided just what we needed a clean and quiet room and a place to store our bags the next day while we explored the city before hopping on the red eye to boston all the staff members were very welcoming and accommodating and the location was great for being tourists for the day,tripadvisor
968,hotel is great nautical theme tons of history directly across the street is the bay on one side is a very nice park with the start of the cablecar line the people in the hotel did a great job of making us feel athome even though we were strangers when we checked in john with the helmet and danny helped us get in and marilyn behind the desk even helped our family up to our room made sure we were comfortable and even helped us plan our exploring our room overlooked the street and bay so we felt inthemix the room was spacious enough to play around and stash our bags to the side plenty of pics online already not sure if the folks saw we were stressed from the plane ride or what but they made this hotel the place to be,tripadvisor
969,made a second trip to the argonaut despite reservations of the previous trip didnt like the neighborhood or the crowds but stayed again because 1 the rooms are comfortable and clean 2 it is possible to get connecting rooms for families 3 other kimptons in sf didnt seem better appreciated the acces to public transportation a real plus,tripadvisor
970,this was a great location you can walk to everything and the trolley car is right next to the hotel we had two rooms and they both were beautifully decorated and very comfortable we wish the museum inside the hotel had longer hours we never had a chance to visit it we traveled with a bus tour the only disappointment was the breakfast it was not a very good buffet,tripadvisor
971,this is more than a place to lay your head it is a destination the bay view rooms are beautifully charming and the location is perfect i highly recommend this hotel for couples or families kids ben jerrys right next door,tripadvisor
972,i would book again at the argonaut ditto the noble house chain staff there very helpful pleasantsan francisco very expensive and depressing lots of younger homeless obviously on drugsvery sad ca is no longer the land of milk honey,tripadvisor
973,we had a great stay and a wonderful meal at the on site restaurant the blue mermaid hotel is very clean beds are comfy cannot beat the view from the bay view rooms we could see the golden gate bridge and the cable car turn around staff is friendly the lobby is very welcoming with a large fireplace and games you can borrow fun beer fountain too large rooms especially for san francisco try the crab chowder at the blue mermaid its amazing,tripadvisor
974,nice hotel great location have stayed at the argonaut several timesmy first choice when in san francisco jr at the front was helpful and kind the blue mermaid has great food and service will stay again,tripadvisor
975,me and my partner staying in this hotel in san francisco as part of a trip to america we was amazing with the size of the whole place rooms were massive very happy with the location walking distance to everywhere would recommend this place to anybody has everything in a hotel you are looking for with excellent customer service,tripadvisor
976,firstly i want to thank the reviewers who wrote about argonaut as they were quite spot on the location is perfect its not as noisy as you would expect it to be as it is further up north from pier39 and most of the hustle and bustle of fishermans wharf make sure you dont miss the powell hyde turnaround right by the side before you reach ghiradelli square the maritime national historical park is a great place to walk about make sure you visit the maritime museum and the hyde street pier i was a little bit disappointed not all the exhibit areas of the museum was open i think it was maintenance work walk out on the municipal pier for a view of the sf golden gate bridge as for the hotel the staff are very friendly and very helpful we had to pay extra 50bucks to check in earlier than 3pm but we were upgraded to a bigger room so no complaints there the bathtub faucet diverter was really tight and difficult to use but the service was excellent the guy came almost immediately after we reported it note that because of the pandemic you do need to inform them if you want the room serviced otherwise you can ask for fresh towels and more coffee any time bring your own tea satchets though if you want a cuppa we tried asking but they didnt supply that if you have kids just be aware the cute soft toy on the bed is not a freebie the rooms are clean check out the mini museum just straight on from the reception its so cool to be in an historical building the nautical theme interior design is in line with the location maritime national historical park and when you head out for the day the staff was so kind they offered us bottled water if you need them back to location its close to the muni f line if the cable car proves a tad pricey with the muni mobile app you can buy a day pass for the cable car and ride them all for the experience its fun otherwise walking around this area is delightful,tripadvisor
977,this beautiful historic gem in the heart of fishermans wharf easy access to ghirardelli square the wharf shopping just across the street alcatraz tours trolley station bicycle rentals and the golden gate bridge you can get everywhere from here the hotel is located as part of a restored cannery and keeps all the best features exposed brick walls massive beams and doors but adds all the modern amenities while we had miraculously good weather on our early february visit we still had moments where we appreciated the lobby fireplace we dined at the blue mermaid al fresco to the soft sounds of very talented street musicians first a saxophonist followed by a bluesy jazzy vocalist the quintessential chowder in a bread bowl was perfect the wine a perfect accompaniment after a long travel day from the east coast and the service was attentive this was truly a sublime vacation for us we saw new things in san francisco that we had not seen before always a possibility in san francisco we played hard and were so grateful for our gorgeous and comfortable room to return to,tripadvisor
978,i would give this hotel three and a half stars but i am giving them 4 for the benefit of the doubt it is simply too expensive for what you get we booked two connecting rooms one a suite and the other to my recollection i was told a suite facing the water that is why we selected this hotel when we arrived the record showed differently and both of our suite and room were facing the street the building is old and the windows small although i know the management can do little about that another big surprise upon arrival was that the concierge worked remotely most of the time that was our first visit to san francisco and although the concierge responded to our calls quickly it would have been easier if she was live sometimes only one person was at the front and we could not ask lengthy questions and have others waiting in line behind us several positive things about this hotel one main item is the excellent location it is close to all the tourist areas they had a very nice staff and they tried to be helpful the surroundings were very quiet even though we were very close to all the action the beds were very comfortable they had a very nice restaurant attached to the hotel,tripadvisor
979,the location is dynamite right by the water and next to ghirardelli the staff is so friendly and anticipates your needs the rooms are very clean and we had a stunning view of alcatraz i highly recommend and will definitely be back,tripadvisor
980,first of all the location was more than we hoped for hotel is located 15 min walk from the pier 39 and 3 min walk from both cable car turnaround and ghirardelli square there are plenty of restaurants and pubs near the hotel so it was good to relax and enjoy at the same time the hotel also allowed us to keep our luggage 4 days prior to check in which made our road trip easier the room is well furnished and i loved the bay view it could be a bit noisy during the weekend afternoon but i thoguht that was also the part of the touristy atmosphere,tripadvisor
981,we were right around the corner from the trolley turnaround stop ghirardelli and the golden gate park great view of alcatraz and bridge room was beautiful bed were beyond comfortable and we even had robes dont bother to bring soap because they provide the best smelling soap and shampoo mini bar was a hit with kids a little pricy but so is everything else in san fran we did not eat there we decided to eat where the locals go first night we stay at a cheaper hotel what a mistake that was dont over think you wont regret staying at the arganout,tripadvisor
982,this hotel always pops up on travel sights when searching san francisco while its not a fivestar destination its a very nice property the rooms are clean and very comfortable great beds we had a room without a view basically an internal alley facing other rooms but who stays in their room in san francisco there are countless restaurants and attractions in walking distance it is right next to the cable car turnstile making it very convenient to get to chinatown or just go for a ride after stays in the business district as well as union square i find this area nice and i surprisingly dont have a sense of tourist overload i will absolutely stay here again,tripadvisor
983,pretty disappointing stay particularly because the was almost empty due to fears over the coronavirus when we arrived we were assigned by a disinterested employee arguably the worst room in the hotel second floor interior dark view of roofing etc after specifically requesting an upper floor and bay view my guess is that the room assignment may have been because we were able to secure an excellent rate due to march visit and low occupancy not sure why our request was completely ignored television was glitchy turning off at will and when we request a late checkout we were told check out is noon no exceptions regardless of occupancy etc have stayed at this property in the past and enjoyed it very much as its location is perfect for exploring the fishermans wharf area access to cable cars ghirardelli square etc not this time particularly at this price point even with a great deal we still paid 25000 per night we had a choice between the fairmont and the argonaut hotel both at the same price point at this point in time we made a mistake its not the cool class hotel weve frequented in the past very dissatisfied and disappointing,tripadvisor
984,my husband and i are from the east coast and spent 3 nights at the argonaut hotel this hotel was fabulous the standard room is very spacious and the nautical decor is ideal for its fishermans wharf setting the bed was extremely comfortable the location is absolutely perfect you have access to everything from that location including the powell hyde street cable car trolleys lombard street ghirardelli square alcatraz and amazing restaurants the concierge desk staff were extremely helpful in planning our trips so we got the most out of the area in the short time we were there take advantage of the complimentary bikes and ride over the golden gate bridge book this hotel you wont be disappointed,tripadvisor
985,jo d than you so much for the raving review the argonaut is definitely the ultimate destination as we are located on the waterfront in the heart of all local attractions the cable car turn is next to the hotel ghirardelli square is a block away lombard street is two blocks away both the aquatic park and hyde street pier is across the street and pier 39 is just steps away please come see us again when your in san francisco best wishes keith hotel operations manger,tripadvisor
986,the argonaut hotel is in the historic cannery in san francisco the rooms are very nice but try to get a room facing out if possible the hotels blue mermaid restaurant is excellent the hotel is close to all the restaurants and attractions on fishermans wharf it is a bit pricey but it is a great hotel in a great location,tripadvisor
987,the argonaut was awesome to say the least right on fishermans wharf there was always something to do our room had a bay view and also the girardelli sign the room was always clean and had a lot of character,tripadvisor
988,we booked this room for two days prior to a cruise the location was fantastic close to fishermans wharf but far enough from the craziness of that area we dined at the restaurant several times and were impressed with the quality of the food and the friendly waitstaff everyone in the hotel was friendly helpful without being in your face and very knowledgeable about the area we would stay there again in a heartbeat,tripadvisor
989,rooms kind of small i called and told them it was our anniversary and they offered to upgrade to bay view when we checked in was given non view room called office and was told no notification so no upgradenice place but rooms are small and there is zero view from the non view rooms except a wall overall nice stay,tripadvisor
990,my wife and i stayed here for the first 3 nights of our us road trip the argonaut was 50 in a cab and about 45mins from the airport in evening rush hour traffic we upgraded to a suite on the top floor room 411 which had a side view over the bay and was incredibly spacious with a big bed and roomy shower just what we needed after a long flight the breakfast at the blue mermaid next door was decent but we found more choice and better value at joanies and black pojnt nearby the hotel was well situated for exploring fishermans wharf including the vibrant pier 39 and getting to the alcatraz ferry at pier 33 many great eating options nearby and next door to the cable car which is a great option for getting up the hills and into the city only 6 very easy to get to the gg bridge from here too would definitely recommend staying here over some of more well known but pricier hotels in the city value parking at 50 plus tax per night was steep but perhaps typical of sf,tripadvisor
991,great location for a first time trip as you are right by fishermans wharf lots of restaurants and places to eat blue mermaid restaurant next door which does great chowder cycle hire icecream shop a few doors away starbucks behind hotel if you like chocolate the hotel is just across from ghirardelli square with its restaurants and chocolateice cream parlour is just a 5 minutes walk across and being hotel the hotel in also right by the beach so you can do some nice walks we walked all the way to golden gate bridge and back which took about 2 and half hours but you can cycle it quicker powell and hyde tram stop is just next door to the hotel although it does get busy at peak times i am in two minds about the hotel itself its very stylish and boutique but just did not have the wow factor which for the price was disappointing felt a bit to business like,tripadvisor
992,i have really mixed feelings about this hotel parts i absolutely love and somethings just want to make you go arrghhh we loved its location its right opposite a trolley stop and a short walk to fishermans walk and all the main attractions the room was lovely spacious and spotlessly cleanoverlooked the golden gate bridgeso whats not to love we arrived at 1am in the morning struggling with three large cases after a 16 hr flight the security guard just said hi no offer of help night receptionist was lovely and very polite we got a really great room however the noise from the air conditioning was just so loudso we switched it offstill really loud noise also came from the fridge switching on and off very loud spoke to the lovely reception staff in the morning who said oh its probably because the air conditioning equipment is on the roof but we will check it came back a few hours later it has been reported fixed at 110pm nothing had changed at all for 4 days it just made a loud noise on several days i asked if the concierge was available to be told oh we do not have one today one arrived on our check out day we were really looking forward to dining in the restaurant having read the reviewsthe food was lovelythe staff were really poor and it was the worst service we received in our whole stay in the usa after dinner we went to the lovely hotel lounge and i asked at reception where the bar was to get a nightcap by the lovely fireplace oh the only bar is in the restaurant and it closes at 9pmif you go outside of the hotel turn left and there is a bar up the street we have never stayed in a hotel with a bar that closes at 9pm leaving was a little like arriving reception staff lovely really helpfultwo members of staff on the door let me struggle with three large bags offering no help at all so overall if you want a funky hotel close to the wharf and if you are prepared to put up with noisy rooftop air conditioning have no bar after 9pm and some really helpful staff and some really unhelpful staff its for you personally we would think twice as the little bits which would have made the stay magical were just missing i am afraid which is sad to saybut eh it might just me me,tripadvisor
993,we stayed here on our family vacation to ca in june and it was top notch all the way around of all the properties we visited while in ca expensive national park properties included the argonaut hotel was our absolute favorite their attention to detail both in cleaning and in decorhotel furnishings is remarkable the property is located at a terrific spot along the pier area and is walking distance to all the major tourist spots there is also a parking garage just behind the hotel that is super convenient if you have a vehicle the staff was extremely hospitable and i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to san francisco,tripadvisor
994,the argonaut is well positioned at the end of the strip about 15 minutes walk from pier 39 and with views over the golden gate bridge its an old converted warehouse so the rooms retain some industrialnautical fittings they are spacious and well appointed there are plenty of restaurants close by to stagger back from and a beach to sit and watch the sunset san francisco is worth a visit and the argonaut is a comfortable clean and handy hotel to explore it from we recommend a tour by extranomical tours and ask for guide tony he brought a personal touch to site seeing the city,tripadvisor
995,loved the argonaut staff were friendly rooms comfortablerestaurant was excellent we really liked the decorthe mix of old and new the location was ideal i would definitely recommend this hotel to my family and friends,tripadvisor
996,we spent three nights at the argonaut while sightseeing around the city the staff was professional friendly and very helpful in planning tours during our stay we were in town for fleet week and it was the perfect location for seeing the fantastic airshow highly recommend this hotel a long weekend stay in sf,tripadvisor
997,we decided to stay at the argonaut for the start of our trip to the states the hotel concierge was great and helpful and the check in was fast and good we didnt have a car but parking is very expensive the whole of san francisco is expensive in every way so the hotel was no exception great location to visit the wharf and plenty of places to eat and busestrams to catch would thoroughly recommend the hotel,tripadvisor
998,on arriving at the hotel it was exactly what was expected we had read up visited the site seeing in person was so much better room was lovely and so boutique we honestly couldnt have asked for a better room even the view we opened the blinds to see the golden gate bridge honestly this is an amazing hotel however dont get taken in by the free breakfast offers they arent worth it 4 pieces of toast 2 slices of bread and not enough jam and the service is absolutely terrible from waiting at the door for 5 minutes to not being served or forgotten about fortunately plenty of other places to eat,tripadvisor
999,an absolutely well led and beautiful hotel with an extraordinary good breakfast restaurant the barista and his capuccino just a blast friendly staff allover the closeness to pier 41 and 39 and specially to the turning point of the cable car makes the hotel an ideal one to explore and enjoy san francisco we will come back,tripadvisor
1000,rooms good restaurant prices mid range beds very comfy rooms super spacious very handy for fishermans wharf area wifi not the best but workable discount vouchers for food and beverage offered on arrival make eating in hotel very competitive would go back,tripadvisor
1001,we took our 2 boys to san francisco for spring break and stayed here for 5 nights first of all the location could not be better we had a view of the golden gate bridge from our window and a view of the cable cars getting ready for the day everything you want to do is walking distance or a short uber ride in the lobby there is a maritime museum run by the national parks service that is really well done and my boys earned a park service badge there is also a beach across the street that we could walk on if you are doing a family trip to san francisco this is the place food was excellent at the blue mermaid too,tripadvisor
1002,we really enjoyed our stay at the argonaut hotel perfectly located near all the sites we wanted to enjoy while in san francisco we had an interior room with no view but the comfort of the room and bed made up for it its decorated super cute blue mermaid attached to the hotel was yummy love the bread bowl corn and crab chowder would definitely stay here again,tripadvisor
1003,i was aware of the daily 25 resort fee but please tell me how the word resort applies upon arrival at our floor there were 2 trays of half eaten meals on the floor and 2 additional empty cocktail glasses at the foot of my room and there they remained for the next 2 days getting a single additional bar of soap proved quite the challenge with your staffregardless of asking no extra soap bar to be found in our bathroom and so we remained one little square of soap for my wife and i for our 6 night stayby day 3 i bought my own i enjoy music as much as anyone but i dont care to hear that disco beat pounding through the lobby and on the elevators at 56 am why 5am because thats the time i left my room every morning to walk to a local starbucks to get coffee 10 for your pot of 2 small cups did i mention the 25 daily resort fee oh that must mean the restaurant area deck chairs against the back wall adjacent to the restrooms shower curtains must be expensive to replace as evidenced by the mold along the bottom of mine there is some good to be said excellent locationyour desk staff is quite nice and friendlyyour blue mermaid restaurant staff were extremely pleasant and attentive and i was more than happy to leave them generous tips its the little thingsget your stuff together,tripadvisor
1004,this hotel in in a great place very close to everything pier 39 the golden gate bridge and alcatraz the rooms had enough space and so was the bathroom nice lounge area just off the foyer which had a fire there and water staff couldnt be more helpful value for money for sure,tripadvisor
1005,best place to be if you want sf bay front lots to visit do this historical hotel it self is beautiful clean rooms beautifully decorated hotel staff very friendly hospitality cable cars 1 block tour buses 2 blocks highly recommend pier 39 10 minute walk view of golden state bridge ghirardelli chocolate factory 5 minute walk and the famous irish coffee at the buena vista cafe one block walk lots of restaurants shops parks we had our car valet which was a little pricy but our car was safe brought to us when needed it one time this historical hotel is a safe place for walking around nite time too,tripadvisor
1006,lovely hotel with no surprises compared to their website friendly staff all round and comfortable rustic rooms close to all the good stuff our only complaint was that the rooms did suffer quite a bit from external noise cars party goers etc but all part of the atmosphere of the area i guess,tripadvisor
1007,we had an incredible stay here the front desk staff was beyond helpful and generous and the lobby is really fun and unique we loved our room we loved the ammenities and we loved the location the wharf is very touristy and busy but it has a charm to it and you can walk to tons of restaurants and bars our 4 year old had a blast and the hotel took great care to make sure he was taken care of we will definitely be coming back,tripadvisor
1008,we stayed at this hotel in san francisco from 26 to 29 may 2019 the hotel is brilliantly located in the very popular fishermans wharf and close to pier 39 the interior is very modern yet authentic to its location i requested a room as high as possible with a view of golden gate and they accommodated our request we were also surprised with a bottle of wine in our room upon arrival checking in was made a pleasant experience by zuri at reception we toured the usa for 4 weeks and this was by far the best checkin of all the hotels what a pleasant lady the room was extremely big and equipped with every luxury you could wish for the restaurant at the hotel the blue mermaid is a must visit when staying at this hotel the food and service were fantastic and the firepits outside were perfect for late afternoon cocktails thanks to our server mikael awesome service parking was available right behind the hotel at very affordable rates being faced as south africans with an extremely negative exchange rate of rand to dollar we were happy with all the discounts provided by the hotel regarding drinks bicycle rental etc just take care that bicycle rental is free but as always there is a but to this privilege when we requested to take advantage of the offer at 17hoo we were told all the vouchers were finished for the day luckily the bicycle rental place accommodated us we enjoyed our stay very much and i would stay at this hotel again without any doubt we can highly recommend it the only negative aspect regarding this hotel was concierge it felt like this gentleman was doing us a huge favour asking for information and help we experienced this on all three occasions we asked for assistance after all that is his job and privilege to help us this was really the only negative aspect about this hotel its concierge service,tripadvisor
1009,the location is absolutely unbeatable and so are the views you are minutes away from almost all of san franciscos major sights the building itself is stunning historic it is very well maintained and clean we loved the obvious fishing theme throughout ultimately what made it phenomenal was the service every person we came in contact with was super nice they knew everything and gave great recommendations i highly recommend staying here when visiting san francisco,tripadvisor
1010,the argonaut hotel is a great place to stay while in san francisco its walking distance to lots of things to see in the city and its a good value too i would encourage anyone to stay there good for business and family travel,tripadvisor
1011,argonaut is a lovely hotel clean and comfortable the staff are friendly and helpful it is conveniently located at the end of jefferson street by the hydepowell cable car terminal it is within walking distance to the famous pier 39 and all the hoponhopoff bus terminalsoffices there are tons of eating places close by we used lyft to get to and from the airport and it cost about 35,tripadvisor
1012,first trip to san francisco we found this hotel by chance when researching districts as we were only in the area for 4 days and wanted to be central for everything the hotel lived up to our expectations room and dcor lovely fantastic view from our room of alcatraz bar and restaurant were great too staff very helpful and friendly we would not hesitate to recommending this hotel,tripadvisor
1013,i booked this hotel for a fun trip with my son for his birthday the location was perfect walking distance to everything we wanted to do every staff member went out of their way to make us feel right at home they went above and beyond from the beautiful birthday surprise for my son to giving us the most spectacular room and always asking if we need anything everyone was always happy to see us and we felt right at home we loved waking up and getting the bicycles from the concierge we biked over the golden gate bridge and it was spectacular the location was ideal for us to walk to fabulous restaurants and sightsee but was far away from the tourist area it was quiet i loved waking up early the streets were so quiet it was like a movie set i enjoyed sitting on the beach by the swim club across the way i love the green lawn by ghirardelli and who wouldnt want to be able to walk right to the choctaw factory we didnt want to leave and decided to make it an annual trip thank you to everyone for making our stay so memorable we loved the hotel if i could give it six stars i would thats how happy i was i cant wait to see you again,tripadvisor
1014,wow we just checked out of argonaut this morning and i wish we couldve stayed longer the service was impeccable so welcoming and friendly at every encounter jeremiah and jason helped us with our car and luggage at check in and we needed help we are in the middle of a move and had plenty in tow with us we ordered from the restaurant for pickup and they brought it up to us instead the front desk team even watched my daughters fish for us while we walked to get coffee after check out the room was easily the best weve stayed at in sf super spacious and clean location of this hotel cant be beat for proximity to all things to do,tripadvisor
1015,the door man john is amazing everyone was very nice i would recommend for everyone to stay here the location was perfect had a wonderful view of alcatraz island within walking distance of the entire wharf,tripadvisor
1016,this hotel was wonderful i love the ambiance and decor with exposed brick walls and large wooden beams the location couldnt have been more idealright in the heart of fishermans wharf and just a few minutes walk from pier 39 and ghiradelli square we could see the water from our room and watch the fishing boats leave each morning i also love how the shuttered windows actually opened so we could enjoy the cool breeze and sounds of the citya luxury not many hotels afford we reserved three rooms for our trip and had several requests including a pack n play the staff was very accommodating and pleasant our room had two doubles so our daughter could have her own bed and our son slept in a pack n play there was plenty of room for the portable crib suitcases accommodating a family of four and a stroller we did not fee cramped at all i also enjoyed the wonderfully comfy robes we put the lovely lobby to good use and finished each night of our stay with a drink from the blue mermaid and conversation around the fireplace it was a great spot for a nightcap and room for the kids to stretch their legs and play we did have an issue after our stay with our credit card being charged several times for additional rooms even thought we had paid upfront for a package deal but with one short phone call everything was swiftly cleared up and apologies made overall i would highly recommend this darling boutique hotel to anyone staying in the heart of san fran we thoroughly enjoyed our stay,tripadvisor
1017,love the argonaut very personable staff which go out of their way to accommodate their guests ive stayed there before my last stay will stay there again it is located in the perfect spot between the buena vista the gold dust scomas my favorite places in s f,tripadvisor
1018,firstly a great location if you are a first timer in sfan easy walk along the fisherman wharf area to pier 39 and to the alcatraz ferries what was dissapointing and not the argonauts fault was the very large number of homeless people in that area which made it too uncomfortable for a pleasure walk we paid 900 for two nights room only not inexpensive in any country but we expected sheer luxury and was happy to pay unfortunately in my opinion the luxury fell way short we had an inside room that looked into all the other inside rooms looking into our room so not great the decor was basic so all in dissapointing the connected blue marlin bar continued our dissapointment as we had breakfast but the restaurant was not immaculate and the staff dressed in jeans and casual shirts that didnt exude quality we know sf is a very expensive city but this didnt stack up they do offer complementary basic drinks of beer wine between 5pm and 6pm call me a tight scotsman but at maybe 10 each this didnt make a 3 star hotel worth 5 star prices could do better to ensure guests return,tripadvisor
1019,it was our third time at the argonaut its a good choice great location but still quiet the room is large and clean unfortunately carpeting which i dont like what we didnt like and remembered differently was breakfast there are various dishes to choose from from from the menu next time wed go somewhere else for breakfast,tripadvisor
1020,the location of this hotel is a+ and a very classy place to stay easy walk to lots of attractions in san francisco the hotel room was a good size and comfortable very cute ocean themed room including octopus wallpaper in the bathroom which i would love in my home the only downsides were that i wish there was more staffguest interaction which would make it feel more welcoming the shower wasnt very hot and reception took quite a large deposit upon check in more than the total amount of my accommodation and it took 2 weeks to clear which hurt my credit card for future hotel deposits however these werent huge issues and i would 100 return on my next trip,tripadvisor
1021,we are taking a road trip around west coast and sf is first stop argonaut gives a flavour of the bygone fishing industry but with modern take loved it especially our first taste of chowder great location for fishermans wharf outside eating at the mermaid was a delight even when slightly chilly with heaters everywhere,tripadvisor
1022,we totally enjoyed our 7 night stay at the argonaut hotel when we got to the room i found a complimentary bottle of dry red wine its like they knew thats my favorite wine the front desk employees were so friendly and helpful if i go back to san francisco id definitely stay there again,tripadvisor
1023,we loved this place the room was beautiful bright and clean location was perfect short walk to pier 39 and the alcatraz tours close to ghiradelli square less than a 5 minute walk to the stop for the hop onoff bus and 2 mins from the cable car station it suited us perfectly the room was decorated beautifully the staff were all super friendly and the hotel is gorgeous wouldnt stay anywhere else in san fran,tripadvisor
1024,on our last trip to san fran 10 years ago we passed the argonaut and said well stay there the next time well it took a decade but we did it and im glad we did great location excellent staff perfect kimpton experience dont think twice just book it,tripadvisor
1025,great hotel great location if a little expensive i would definitely recommend sf cycle the golden gate bridge and see alcatraz the hotel bar offers great cocktails and bat snacks we had a suite which was plenty of room for a family of five,tripadvisor
1026,we stayed during our recent trip to celebrate our 39th wedding anniversary nice hotel nice rooms of a good size we booked a suite but in hindsight we would have been fine without the extra room because the bedroom was spacious definitely worth staying,tripadvisor
1027,nice friendly hotel ideally situated near fishermans wharf standard boutique fair its a great base for exploring wasnt noisy was well equipped and very near the cable car stop long term stay might get expensive but for a long weekend to blitz san fran it is perfect,tripadvisor
1028,this is a great hotel beautiful rooms great helpful staff location is excellent in the heart of everything we stayed as a family for 3 nights would highly recommend hotel arrange everything from trips to sightseeing all done with a smile an old fashioned polished service we loved it,tripadvisor
1029,this is a really fun hotel in a great location we arrived a bit late in the day and since we missed the wine tasting happy hour were given vouchers for cocktails at the restaurant connected to the hotel when this happens you know it is going to be a good stay the hotel decoration is nautical themed nicely done and just a tiny bit over the top but memorable the rooms very nice and spacious comfy beds and linens a great bathroom and quiet the restaurant is very good the location is awesome walking distance to the piers with plenty of restaurants nearby highly recommended,tripadvisor
1030,we have stayed here multiple times the location of this hotel cannot be beat it is right next to fishermans wharf but it is at the very end by beach street so you dont get all of the crowds and commotion beach street is the terminus of the cable car line so you can hop on and be to union square or market street in no time the trolley line is also close by so you can get down to the embarcadero or att park the hotel itself is in the old cannery building the brick and exposed beams give it a very unique feel they usually have a wine and cheese reception in the lobby in the late afternoon it is on the above average end of the price range but you get what you pay for and it often prices out the noisy kids in the am and the partying young adults in the evening you can walk to excellent restaurants along the wharf great place for a romantic weekend,tripadvisor
1031,best choice i never made the office executive assistant booked this for me and i was pleasantly surprised the staff were all very helpful and friendly i needed help printing out something late on my first night and the front desk was more than happy to help me obtain what i needed the room was very clean and comfortable i actually was given free wifi i am not certain if that is some arrangement my executive assistant made or something they offered for the conference i was there for but it was free i did eat at the restaurant attached to the hotel one evening it is a pretty good choice if you do not feel like venturing out however the hotel is within walking distance to some tourist attractions and several very good restaurants when i return for the conference this year i will request to stay here,tripadvisor
1032,we stayed on the 4th floor in a bay view room which was incredible the views of the bridge and the bay awesome great breakfast and service will definately stay here again the next time we are in san francisco,tripadvisor
1033,the hotel is located in the heart of fishermans wharf with lots of tourist but the rooms are very quiet and nicely renovated we loved the spacious room for san francisco and we had a partial ocean view too because the parking was more than we wanted to pay we didnt rent a car while we stayed here taxis were readily available and the staff were all very friendly and helpful,tripadvisor
1034,charming ambiance and beautifully kept our room was perfect for our trip with 2 teenage boys plenty of space and truly impeccable service located just a few blocks for everything on fishermans wharf theres no need to drive the furthest attraction was the ferry to alcatraz and it was less than a mile away convenient lovely and a perfect landing spot for our trip thank you to the staff of the argonaut for making our stay in san francisco absolutely perfect,tripadvisor
1035,argonaut is at the end of the embarcadero road and youre right in and on the action the rooms are comfortable and very clean the housestaff is superb front desk and concierge were very helpful only drawback is the onsite dining facility which is mediocre at best if you want an over the top breakfast experience walk three short blocks to the hollywood cafe the short wait is worth it,tripadvisor
1036,we found this hotel after walking out of a reservation that same day this was a perfect location spacious room very comfy beds delicious restaurant and friendly staff we highly recommend this and weee so glad we left the other and found this gem,tripadvisor
1037,the argonaut is right by everything san francisco has to offer you can use cable cars that connect to muni to really get around town we found the room comfortable with a friendly staff that worked hard to meet expectations,tripadvisor
1038,the argonaut is located right on the water front just a few steps from pier 39 lots of tourist attractions etc in the area location wise you cant beat it the hotel itself is what i will call eclectic elegance with a rustic charm service is wonderful the restaurant is also top notch beds are super comfortable with great pillows my review is based on staying in one of the suites but ive seen the rooms and they appear to be just as nice in short this is one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in,tripadvisor
1039,we loved the argonaut it is in a perfect location and is so comfortable just what we needed as travellers from the uk the room was perfect the beds were a dream and the bathroom was stunning the whole hotel has such characterand the first thing you see as you walk out of the door is alcatraz and its right next to the famous cable car wed love to return one day,tripadvisor
1040,we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the argonaut great room great service quiet and easily walkable to great restaurants the alcatraz launch and all of fishermans wharf and trolleys and the cable car hub were close as well making it easy to get from the airport as well as to other sights downtown,tripadvisor
1041,would definitely stay here again ideal location right on the pier staff were very friendly and accommodating the restaurant was reasonably priced especially with the daily 10 residents discount,tripadvisor
1042,amazing location close to everything that you might want not a huge amount in the way of facilities at the hotel but clean comfortable rooms with good beds and sound insulation most of rooms do not have any kind of view despite the location,tripadvisor
1043,my husband and i have been to sf many times but have never stayed on the wharf we chose this hotel from expedia and were not disappointed the location is great for all sf has to offer the hotel door is right next to ben and jerrys and the waffle cone smell greeted us each morning the hotel is very clean the beds comfy and the decor wowed me every detail was thought outthe chandeliers in the lobby the colors the chairs the fixturesloved it our room was nice and quiet and we had room service twice which was yummy check out the adjoining wine bar,tripadvisor
1044,understanding that we are i san francisco and that the hotel is very well positioned i still think there are better value for money options around or more luxury options if money is not a problem the rooms are nice but small many with no views on the bay the lobby is nice and there is a lively atmosphere and becomes very busy for the happy hour around 5 with wine and beer offered parking around is very complicated so the almost 60usd valet is almost a bargain,tripadvisor
1045,very nice hotel clean comfortable quiet spacious rooms helpful accommodating staff excellent location near activities sights parks restaurants wish we could have stayed longer in this convenient locationdelightful hotel,tripadvisor
1046,im staying at the argonaut for a few days for a conference its in a terrific location on fishermans whart but i wouldnt rate it as a luxury hotel despite the luxury hotel price tag our room on the second floor has no view at all and is a bit short on amenities no turn down service no complementary bottles of water its really just an average hotel in a great location the concierge and front desk staff are friendly and helpful but our room had coffee grounds in the bathroom sink when we arrived so the cleaning left a bit to be desired and its either the walls that are thin or just bad design but you can hear what is going on in the room next to you next time ill book a hotel in the downtown area and enjoy the walk to fishermans wharf as opposed to staying in this hotel,tripadvisor
1047,i booked this hotel for two reasons 1 i had stayed here before and liked that it is so close to everything along the pier 2 second time was for the shark fest that was right a cross the street from the hotel this place is comfortable and the staff has always been very friendly,tripadvisor
1048,stepping into the argonaut at fishermans wharf was like stepping into a dream i frequent san francisco annually for my daughters birthday and had requested other hotels to offer her something for her birthday but no one remembered the argonaut remembered and delivered sharon the front desk staff is extremely helpful kind and accommodating i appreciate how she listened and helped us the whole staff from the valet to thebelman to the front desk was amazing the restaurant is delicious true cuisine thank you aragonout for accommodating my daughter and i for her 14th birthday i appreciate you all and we will be coming back,tripadvisor
1049,this is undoubtedly one of the best hotels i have stayed in the rooms are enormous and beautifully appointed the staff were very friendly and helpful there is a large lounge area with relaxing chairs and an open fire a good restaurant and an outside eating area with fire pits no expense has been spared in the refurbishment making it a much sought after location parking is by valet service and quite expensive at 59 per day but the location close to fishermans wharf and the trolleybus terminus makes it very convenient we did not use our car during the four day stay,tripadvisor
1050,this hotel is a nice hotel in a great location for activities with kids great places to walk you can ride over the golden gate bridge there is a beach head down all the piers catch the hyde st cable carthe hotel itself is nice but the walls seemed a little thin as we could hear the rooms next door tv at night and doorbell in the morning quite well staff were great as well as the wine hour and fruit water would stay here again with kids,tripadvisor
1051,we really liked the argonaut during our four day stay the location is just perfect the staff were very helpful and housekeeping were excellent good sized rooms and ours had a view of the golden gate bridge just we would have given the argonaut an unreserved five star rating but it is terribly let down by the shambles which is their blue mermaid restaurant poor service and poor food on our last day there were evidently staffing problems and we were asked to wait 20 mins for a table in fairness when i told peter at reception he did say the management were aware of the problems and were working to resolve them the sooner the better we highly recommend the argonaut and hope that the catering issues are resolved by the time you arrive,tripadvisor
1052,when i traveled to san francisco ive always used sir francisco drake under total renovation or hotel vital closed during pandemic so i had to find a new option my requirements are 1 pet friendly 2 close to grassy area 3 fun and safe location ive found this cute hotel on bringfidocom and checked google map and found its at the end of fishermans village area and is right next to the maritime park with huge grass area though i wish they didnt have a pet fee like sir francis drake or vital its 75pet per stay hotel staff are super friendly and nice decor is cute and rooms are spacious and comfortable overall it was a very good choice for us id come back to stay here with my dogs again,tripadvisor
1053,we stayed here while in the city for a wedding the location was great as everyone had access to the main tourist areas and great dining i found the atmosphere fun and the decor eclectic bedding was comfortable and clean we had a great view from our room as did others in our party but some felt their rooms had too much street noise it was not peaceful at night but not to be expected in a setting such as this,tripadvisor
1054,excellent experience checkin an hour early quick very informative and helpful stayed in a deluxe king comfy bed large room and setup with sofa area perfect location for touring the city restaurant attached to the hotel for convenience all employees were helpful and pleasant everyone was masked would definitely stay again,tripadvisor
1055,the argonaut used to be a kimpton and was bummed out to hear that it was not this is not my first trip but upon arriving i noticed things were the same if not better if you want a hotel with about as good a location as you can get to the piers this is it the rooms are a great size and clean and cool as always,tripadvisor
1056,loved the location close to all the major sites to see and very convenient for us to pop in and out of the hotel during the day also liked that the hotel was a bit removed from the major crowds dont think you need to get a bay view room as youre hardly spending time in your room during the day save your money to use on excursions,tripadvisor
1057,we stayed here for 4 nights we had a bay view room which was large and comfortable with a view of the golden gate bridge the hotel is ideally located to explore the city the cable car starts just outside the hotel so we were able to ride the cable car early before the crowds came along,tripadvisor
1058,we booked a large suite with jacuzzi tub and it was extremely spacious and wellmaintained we had a dining table as well as sofachairs in living area bathroom included jacuzzi tub shower stall and toilet in separate closet we did not request a waterbay view and had a view of the street which was not a problem except for the noise at night the kids slept in the living room pullout sofa so they werent affected by the noise in the main bedroom the staff was super friendly and helpful the hotel location was great for exploring fishermans wharf and alcatraz and for hopping onoff the cable cars we did not eat at the hotel at all during our stay but we would definitely come back to stay here again,tripadvisor
1059,the third floor corner suite we had was perfectly suited for our family of 2 adults and 2 teenagers surprisingly quiet and extremely comfortable with plenty of living space plus a dining table for breakfast in the morning location was great for an evening walk around fishermans wharf and an ideal jumping off point to head over to presidio and the golden gate bridge,tripadvisor
1060,definitely a 4 star hotel nice rooms clean and well maintained it looks like they converted an old post and beam factory there were a couple of 14 wood beams in our room they do have a wonderful hour of wine tasting between 5 and 600 where you actually meet some of your fellow guests the only faults they charge 50day for parking which is horrendous it does include unlimited valet parking but really several nearby hotels offer the same service for 32day you are in the middle of tourist country and it is very busy and intense if this bothers you try somewhere further away you only have to be about blocks from fishermans wharf to be out of the crowds,tripadvisor
1061,the argonaut is not at all corporate it has quirky interiors that work well the staff are friendly and efficient the hotel is an easy walk to all fishermans wharf attractions and only about 30 minute stroll to down town sf rooms are bright and well furnished with usb charging points and wifi,tripadvisor
1062,much better than the downtown hotels very friendly staff well maintained the location is unbeatable close to everything but at the same time in the calmer part of fishermans wharf at the end of jefferson st,tripadvisor
1063,while i have tended to shy away from fishermans wharf the argonaut has changed my mind the staff are exceptionally friendly helpful and just full of good cheer the hotel is well appointed terrifically clean the room is very comfortable and well laid out its quiet its a haven compared to areas of town where many of the big hotels are its certainly everything i need and more on a business trip as other reviewers say it must also be great for vacationers my expectations for this family of hotels is always high but the argonaut has exceeded even those give this place a try its great value and a wonderful experience all around,tripadvisor
1064,this hotel is very nice i had the room shown in the pictures the bed was very comfortable with luxury linens the hotel is located in the middle of fishermans wharf area and the cannery building lots of restaurants and shops in the immediate area hotel security is well done and i felt safe as a female solo traveler the restaurant in the lobby chowder house was very good service was professional and friendly prices were reasonable the only complaint i have is the 30 plus taxes daily resort fee,tripadvisor
1065,we are repeat guests at this hotel this was our first visit since it has been run by noble house group and while the hotel is still as beautiful as ever we were disappointed to notice the usual personalization in service missing this trip i hope that it was just a fluke during past visits weve been greeted by name and friendly commentsquestions about our day by the bellmen as we walked in and out of the front door which made us feel so welcomed and appreciated as guests this trip we were celebrating a very special milestone birthday and it wasnt even really acknowledged nor were we really it doesnt need to be much but the ultimate reason we booked here for this trip was for the personalized service to have it missing was very disappointing especially given we considered two of our favorite hotels and ultimately chose to stay here and paid a higher rate thinking it was worth it for that personalization reason,tripadvisor
1066,we chose the argonaut to be close to san francisco bay for a 1 night stay following a medical appointment the doorman and reception staff were very friendly and professional all covid precautions were observed our room was excellent very comfortable beds quiet with a direct view of the golden gate bridge delicious food at the hotels blue mermaid rates are in line with 4+ and 5 star hotels that we have stayed at in san francisco at the quieter end of fishermans wharf we will recommend to anyone seeking a san francisco experience in a beautiful location on the bay,tripadvisor
1067,hotel was clean spacious and comfortable we didnt spend time in the lobby or bar but it looked nice location was great and area around the hotel felt pretty safe fairly close to great food in chinatown and north beach area overall had a good stay,tripadvisor
1068,found the location and facilities excellent staff professional and friendly we were referred by previous guests who are friends of ours i in turn have since told many others of your hotel one family of which will be booking soon,tripadvisor
1069,we enjoyed the ambience at the argonaut hotel the staff was very friendly and the location is great too unfortunately there were no kingsized beds available we spent 3 nights there and my husband and i joked that we were sleeping in ricky and lucy beds we recently traveled to italy with our children and found that most of the hotels there simply moved two beds together or separated them accommodating the needs of their guests easily the elevators were slow but otherwise it was quite comfortable,tripadvisor
1070,our 3rd stay in the hotel this time for 3 nights from the hotel straight on fishermans wharf next to the hotel the maritime museum ghirardelli park and the cable cars the hotel itself is very luxurious blue mermaid barrestaurant and a fitness center its an old warehouse and beautiful elements are still visible in the rooms,tripadvisor
1071,we spent the night here this month while visiting california the people are sooooo sweet and friendly they ended up giving us free drink coupons free appetizer coupons and let us keep our car there most of the next day while we were sight seeing the city very clean and excellent location,tripadvisor
1072,hello josephine1996 thank you for providing us with such a kind review we are giving some high fives over here at the argonaut after hearing that we made your bucket list what a great idea please come back and see us again soon warm regards marc,tripadvisor
1073,wish we had a longer trip to san francisco so that we could have spent more time at this hotel quaint quiet beautiful property with extremely helpful and friendly staff the cleanliness of the rooms was impeccable very welcoming and enjoyable experience,tripadvisor
1074,great location within walking distance to so many sites and close to cable car station concierge very helpful with planning how to fit the most fun into a short stay valet parking was great room was an interior room and quite small but tastefully decorated and we didnt spend much time there anyway inside rooms are much quieter,tripadvisor
1075,we also stayed here three years ago and im happy to say that the upkeep of the hotel has been great as everything seemed just as it should be this time the staff are friendly rooms large clean and very comfortable considering the hotel is in a very busy location and our room was facing fishermans wharf it was very quiet just around the corner from the argonaut are the cable cars which can get you easily into the city in a very picturesque way,tripadvisor
1076,we stayed here for a girls trip we asked where we could go for happy hour and they told us to check in with the concierge by the time we went up to the room they called with three options for us the beds were super comfortable rooms were very nice the hotel is right across from the beach and the ghiradelli square and right by the embarcadero so we walked everywhere although uber would always be an option the only disappointing thing was when we checked out they charged us a 25 resort fee which i thought was ridiculous because we were not told about it until we checked out however i would stay there again and their staff was extremely helpful we bought our room through groupon but i would not do that again as it would have been cheaper with the triple a discount of twenty percent,tripadvisor
1077,this is simply one of the best hotels weve ever stayed at the friendliness and impeccable service of all the staff ranks this hotel above the other boutique name brands we used to always stay at four seasons hotels i now look for kimpton,tripadvisor
1078,my wife and i have been to san francisco several times over the past 20 years and found the argonaut was a great fit of us and our two teenage daughters the location is right at the end of fishermans wharf in a former 100 year old warehouse it looks like a warehouse with exposed brick and steel beams that looks more than tough enough to survive an earthquake the front desk and the concierge were both helpful with our stay and they easily accommodated us when our flight was cancelled due to bad weather back east down the hallway is a little office area in case you need to jump online and print tickets or other tripbusiness related chores we had an inside room and it was one of the quietest rooms ive ever stayed in most probably due to the brick walls i cant make a comment on the street facing rooms as far as the noise coming from the street the location was very convenient to take a walk down fishermans wharf or to pick up the powellhyde cable car which has a end of the line turnaround right across the side street from 56 pm they have a nightly wine tasting and it changes here and there because i saw beer available and one chilly night they offered hot toddies i didnt hit the onsite gym but i understand its available if you want to get a workout in i almost forgot to mention that theres free wifi throughout the facility if we get a chance to travel to san francisco again i will make the argonaut my first choice,tripadvisor
1079,we decided on taking a quick trip to san fransisco for 1 night we decided on the argonaut hotel because of its central location on the wharf and nob hill hotel is quaint pet friendly and clean prices were a bit high for what we got which was 1 king room with no view staff was friendlyfor some reason there were lots of kids running about the hallways and main entrance of the hotel you could hear them running up and downthats a negative i would recommend this place if you are interested in hanging out on the wharf best thing to do is purchase tickets to the sightseeing double decker buses and do hop ons and offs during the day that way you can see the city and not get caught up in the heavy parking and congestion of the city,tripadvisor
1080,i loved the warehouse feel clever decor with all the steel strapping at baseboards and other areas friendly staff and very helpful with entertainment recommendations great seafood at most restaurants within walking distance we never had to use our car in the two days we were there,tripadvisor
1081,really enjoyed our time at argonaut awesome location literally across the road from the pier fishermans wharf starbucks and ghirardelli square service was fantastic and the room was huge with a great feel to it the building is historic and has an awesome vibe to it,tripadvisor
1082,spent a few days in this hotel late september 2016 its a great location and about a 1 minute walk to the cable car turnaround station where you can hop on and enjoy the world famous clang clang clang went the trolley the f line street car that runs all the way up to castro is at the end of the block also a walgreens store is a short walk complimentary bikes from the bike the bridge shop next door are available the hotel room was ok a little bigger would have been good staff at the hotel were all very friendly helpful and professional we had breakfast one morning in the hotel restaurant sat outside in the sun which was the only positive about the experience find somewhere else for breakfast plenty of choice around,tripadvisor
1083,from check in to check out an unbelievable experience in the heart of the wharf we had the best room and view in the city corinne and steven on check in were fantastic rose the concierge was great help room was clean large and the views were fantastic we will be back on our leaving the doorman was more than helpful in assisting us with our scenic route out of the city beautiful hotel great history not a generic look to it,tripadvisor
1084,a friendly welcome from front of house staff where we were shown a beautiful spacious room with two queen size beds the decor linen etc is first class and we enjoyed our five days stay and look forward to returning one day the lounge is family friendly at night the outside seating area of the bar is pleasant listening to street musicians playing jazz,tripadvisor
1085,the hotel was the perfect location and very nice close to ghiradelli square cable cars starbucks also nice walk to alcatraz tours and pier 39 great restaurant across the street and would definitely stay again,tripadvisor
1086,i was a challenge at first but the front desk attendant kumar was a pro realizing that it was my cab driver not the hotel irritating me i was treated like a valued guest right away and attention to detail was apparent throughout the hotel the guest receptions in the evening are also a nice touch the lobby is inviting and relaxing and we loved that the rooms draw on their cannery history no complaints here i would totally stay here again,tripadvisor
1087,at the pricier end but well worth it beautiful hotel and excellent location near docks for trip to alxatraz near ead of cable car that goes straight past the steep windy road and spitting distance to a good bike hire place for riding over the golden gate bridge good restaurants near by starbucks directly behind and fast food too,tripadvisor
1088,we spent the first night of our honeymoon here over 400 dollars for a very average room with limescale everywhere in the bathroom food also very average in the hotel wont be coming back in a hurry,tripadvisor
1089,have stayed at the argonaut a kimpton hotel on a number of occasions if you want a fishermans wharf location this is an ideal hotel to stay with easy access to the attractions of the wharf and easy access to the tramcar to take you into the centre of the city the rooms are very spacious with all expected amenities one great drawcard is the happy hour each evening when you can attend a wine tasting and have a chat with other guests from various parts of the world would always stay here again if we go to san francisco the restaurant onsite blue mermaid is accessible from the front foyer and serves a good breakfast and a great menu for dinner,tripadvisor
1090,we had a wonderful rime staying at the argonaut so much was within walking distance and if we needed a cab the doorman jason put us in the hands of a truly awesome cab driver the rooms are clean the restaurant has really good food and the wait staff were very friendly and accomodating i will recommend your hotel to anyone i know that plans to visit san fran thank you again,tripadvisor
1091,this is a great hotel in a historic building with lots of character retained from its previous life as a fruit packing warehouse the spacious and long rooms are tastefully done to maintain the character with exposed brick and beams with a nautical twist the hotel building is recessed into a steep hill so if you are in a room at the back of the hotel on the third floor it will still seem like you are almost on ground level so for a higher view ask to be closer to the front of the hotel we were about half way back on the third floor and when looking out of our window it seemed we were almost street level we did have a view of the park and the golden gate bridge in the distance the room had lovely toiletries and bathrobes and a very comfortable bed the wine tasting next to the hotel is worth a visit we had 5 different tasters for 15 with a sparkling and an extra glass thrown in for free the blue mermaid bar and restaurant connected to the hotel is also very good nice dcor and the award winning crab chowder was delicious the free bikes offered by the hotel were all gone by the time we tried to get them which was fine as we walked over the bridge but if this is something you want to do then book early my only negative is just thats its really expensive for a 4 star hotel i suppose it is a lovely hotel right in the tourist area and we were staying over a weekend but our bill for 3 nights without breakfast was nearly 1800ouch it was more expensive than our 5 star apartment room in vegas so although i loved this hotel the price wasnt really justified and i would only stay again if i could get a cheaper deal,tripadvisor
1092,we enjoyed our trip to san francisco and in part do to the great hotel and its location to all sorts of great things to do the rooms are nice and quiet not once were we disturbed by noises coming from the hall or any place we will be back,tripadvisor
1093,we are going to try elsewhere this next time because the 1 bedroom has just gotten too expensive on most days it is nearly 500 and that is not including the parking i understand that this hotel is immaculate and the location is hard to beat near the bay and ghiradelli however they have priced us out,tripadvisor
1094,really enjoyed our stay walking distance to pier 39 and the alcatraz tour right near tram stop room service never seemed to be available unless it was during restaurant hours which kind of defeats the purpose of needing room service,tripadvisor
1095,the argonaut is a really great hotel in the perfect location in fishermans wharf san francisco its suitable for couples and familys in among the action but in the quieter end of the strip the authentic decor has a real historic feel the rooms are a little snug but again are very comfortable with a design in keeping with the history of the area hire bikes ride over the golden gate bridge into sausalito grab some lunch and catch the ferry back past alcatraz dont bike back the hill coming down off the bridge would be really tough and you would miss out on the ferry experience the argonaut provided a great leg on our california road trip,tripadvisor
1096,we booked because of tripadvisor reviews the location was amazing beyond that not worth the money the hotel is dog friendly but maybe they should tell people after 2 miserable nights wheezing and coughing my daughter figured out the problem 2 room moves later the second smelled of smoke we were told we were on a pet fee floor although better i continued to wheeze and wake up with swollen eyes the last night the dog next door barked all night so much for animal free rooms,tripadvisor
1097,it was a first time visit for one of us and the argonaut did not disappoint we had wonderful service proximity to restaurants and places we needed to see and a great concierge who helped us reserve tickets,tripadvisor
1098,i knew this hotel was going to be wonderful and it exceed my expectations we had a bay view king room with a spot on view of alcatraz and some of the golden gate bridge the bed was super comfortable and the location of the room right near the elevator was great it was my birthday and our anniversary so they greeted us in the room with a bottle of wine and snacks with a nice hand written card the lobby was great for kids and adults theres a big warm fireplace that is always on and we met people from out of town just by sitting there there was a tv with kid friendly video games going as well there was even a table with dog treats and poop bags for the dog people you walk out the front door and you are on fishermans wharf and right next to the start of the cable cars right behind the hotel is an early open starbucks and around the corner ghiradelli square could not have asked for a better place to stay oh and theres a restaurant attached as well for meals,tripadvisor
1099,this hotel smells just like a dog kennel which i love dogs but i do not like the smell on my cloths and the whole hotel smells like wet dogs my stay was not pleasant at all i told them i do not want to be put in a room with prior dogs in it i am very allergic to dogsi get hives i did not expect the place to be like this at all the hotel is located in a perfect spot main street and closed to cable cars views of the golden gate bridge because of this i think the hotel gets too many great reviews and if i saw anything about the wet dog smells i would not have booked this hotel at all the worst part was my expensive cloths smelled of dogs all week its was awful,tripadvisor
1100,from the moment we arrived we were greeted by friendly staff and the checkin was as smooth as it could be the lobby common areas and rooms were very clean and tastefully decorated our room faced the courtyard and to our surprise it wasnt noisy,tripadvisor
1101,we needed a local long weekend destination that could cater to my 2 boys imagination and interests and decided that we would brave fishermans wharf in sf which in only about 40 minutes from where we live while searching for hotels near the wharf i got a little concerned none of them quite fit the standards and style we typically prefer when traveling as a family then i found the argonaut lets start with the location it is so close to the wharf and pier and within steps from many family friendly restaurants cafes ice cream shops and stores we were greeted by the most friendly doorman who entertained my boys while we checked in the lobby is beautiful spacious and a perfect place to sit down for a quick drink we were able to stay at one of the suites which was decently spacious and adorable furnished in nautical theme room was clean and the window looked out to the bustling wharf the jacuzzi didnt work but its ok it wanted to avoid it anyways since if my boys got in they wont ever want to get out 45 minutes after we settled into our room we were greeted with a complimentary bottle of wine what a lovely surprise they know tired parents we found the staff extremely kids friendly which is always a relief i loved that even being family friendly they still cared about the little nice luxury details id highly recommend this for anyone looking for a highend but also family appropriate hotel spot wed definitely come back,tripadvisor
1102,the location of the hotel is perfect to walk down fishermans wharf and visit san franciscos piers its near to the platform of powellhyde cable car line which can bring you directly to lombard street,tripadvisor
1103,we stayed at this hotel for 6 days and five nights in mid april the argonaut hotel is located in the perfect location right at the end of fishermans wharf on the main strip upon checkin the staff was friendly and attentive especially with the lobby being pretty busy we arrived early 4 hours before checkin time and were told they could have our room ready early that it would just be a little wait they secured our bags to the side took down our cell phone number and called us within 40 minutes our room was clean updated and comfortable we had the best nights sleep our mini bar was constantly stocked with liter bottles of water daily for us at a price of course this is big for us as we are always having to go out and buy water when on vacation so this was a nice convenience our room was cleaned every morning by the fast and efficient cleaning staff the hotel has an adjacent bar and restaurant there is a complimentary happy hour daily with wine beer connected to the hotel is a maritime museum the hotel has a nautical historical feel which was really cool we used the fitness facilities almost daily while there and it was never over crowded from the hotel there are endless activities and attractions within an easy walking distance ghiraradelli square a starbucks the buena vista restaurant the trolley pick up endless shops and restaurants pier 39 the boat to alcatraz are just some of them there are various bike rentals locally making biking the golden gate very convenient san fran is a beautiful city and we will be sure to return and stay at the argonaut again,tripadvisor
1104,our family of four 2 teenage boys stayed in a deluxe room with 2 queen sized beds the room was pretty comfortable not the biggest weve stayed in but this is an old building that has to accommodate a hotel so that is understandable we had a great stay and the hotel is in the perfect location for a family pluses location easy walk to cable car terminus bike hire for gg bridge lots of family friendly restaurants shops ghirardelli square pier 39 fishermans wharf nice restaurant bar attached comfy lounge area with board games wii great concierge service quiet bedroom minuses lack of clothes storage in bedroom for family of 4 just a small chest of drawers + 2 other drawers a wardrobe nowhere to hang clothes in bathroom when taking a shower pretty low powered shower over the bath restaurant is small for the size of the hotel takes non residents so we faced a 1 hour wait for a breakfast table on checkout day not end of world as other options out of hotel but no warning that we should book either,tripadvisor
1105,we live in the bay area and had a special evening planned so we decided to stay in the city we had not stayed here before but we cant wait to go back the nautical dcor was really well done and did not feel gimmicky the winebeer happy hour was well attended and fun from the front door to the front desk and the housekeepers the staff was friendly welcoming and attentive the bed was comfortable i love the kimpton whimsical touches in the room including the animal print robes and yoga mat oh and the umbrella on a practical note the multiplugs at the desk allowed us to plug in several devices for charging at one time brilliant join the kimpton karma program and you will get wifi and a chance to eat some munchies out of the mini bar included this is hotel is really well located for visitors to san francisco you can walk to the wharf ghirardelli square the cannery be sure to stop at the buena vista for an irish coffee,tripadvisor
1106,great hotel in the best location lovely friendly staff very knowledges and there to help would definitely stay here again great view of alcatraz from the room breakfast at 8am round the first we was amazing too,tripadvisor
1107,we have always enjoyed staying at the agrenout the historical beautiful building at a great location beautiful comfortable rooms great restaurant all staff are very professional and makes you feel at home that is why i can say i recomend you to stay at this hotel next time in sf you will never regret that,tripadvisor
1108,we were encouraged to stay at this hotel whose rates are usually prohibitive to us because of its special offer its a lovely hotel were glad we did the historical nautical theme was consistent throughout the staff was polite considerate informative the room was gorgeous,tripadvisor
1109,beautiful hotel with one of the best views in the city one of the finest rooms ive been in and a perfect location for strolling the waterfront it wasnt cheap but the best rarely is if you want to give someone a first class san francisco experience this is a good place to do it,tripadvisor
1110,stayed here on our last night of our road trip in the us on great ta reviews and i can only agree actually i think it could be the best us hotel i have stayed in not cheap and i agree that breakfast could have been included although that is unusual anywhere these days but i have paid this for a matchbox in london with second hand furniture all the staff were super friendly not just american false if you know what i mean and we were upgraded to a room with a great view of the harbour but still quiet tasteful seaside theme and superfast wifi my only problem was that we only had one night here and had spent many in below par hotels on our trip i wouldnt hesitate to stay here again when in san francisco,tripadvisor
1111,very nice hotel i recommended to my aunt and she stayed in november blue mermaid restaurant was fabulous everyone was friendly and helpful centrally located valet parking i would definitely stay here again,tripadvisor
1112,loved most everything about our two night stay parking was priced too high took the free tour which was an nice amenity the lobby should have more plugs to charge phones as the only ones were located on the high table with stools,tripadvisor
1113,i stayed here for 5 nights to celebrate my 30th birthday it cost us around 1300 the hotel is spotlessly clean and really nicely decorated our room had a view of the golden gate bridge and upon arrival a note to wish me a happy birthday and a bottle of wine were in the roomive no idea how the hotel knew it was my birthday my boyfriend is adamant he didnt mention it so i can only assume this is how much attention to detail is given for booking that they noticed the date all the staff we came across throughout the stay were really friendly and went out of the way to ensure our stay was perfect the wine hour is great the free bicycle hire would have been fantastic if i could ride a bike however after borrowing one from the hotel it became evident very quickly that i lost that ability somewhere in the last 15 years haha the restaurant in the hotel is lovely but there are some really great ones in the courtyard next door too especially the mexican which was excellent the location is perfect easy to get a cab close to sightseeing buses cable car turn table and a short walk to pier 39 easy to walk to the alcatraz landing from here too room was warm and cosy bathrobes were super cute and all the staff we came across were super friendly the only negative point i have about the hotel is that our room whilst lovely was tiny perhaps it was because we had just arrived there after a week in caesars palace lv but im pretty sure we must have had one of the smallest rooms in the hotel it wasnt a problem as we didnt spend long in the room anyway but if you arent planning on exploring and want to stay in the room i would recommend upgrading to a larger room,tripadvisor
1114,first off its a great boutique hotel fairly large with a pretty cool nautical theme the bar at the restaurant downstairs was cool as well everyone was helpful it was clean and upkept very well best part however was the location it is literally across the street from the maritime museum and about a block from fishermans wharf everything youd like to see in a long weekend is in walking distance ie no rental car needed i was at a conference so i didnt have all of the free time in the world but id definitely stay there again for pleasure,tripadvisor
1115,clean warm and comfortable but a long walk from reception to our room friendly staff but once again no free wifi no breakfast included or else they forgot to mention it and the most annoying they even charged for the bottled water in the room certainly americans like to milk every penny they can from tourists but that was pure meanness,tripadvisor
1116,i was told a late checkout was not available but was available for 100 bucks more pretty shady also the walls were pretty thin and if you face the east window the sunlight is pretty strong great location though,tripadvisor
1117,this is the fourth kimpton we have stayed in and one of the best we are loyal to the brand and always try and find a kimpton wherever we go the location of the argonaut is perfect you are on the edge of one of the biggest tourist areas in the world but barely notice having the buena vista next door for breakfast is a huge plus staff at this hotel was hands down friendly courteous and helpful doormen went to great lengths to hail cabs at times running down the street and yelling front desk was super nice on check inout even honoring a rewards perk when they did not have to only real complaint is we never got our fish we noted that this hotel is pet friendly and met some nice dogs in the lobby at times found this to be a plus even though we dont travel with our cats we never heard a bark growl or anything else negative in this regard had a deluxe king room and was very impressed the rawexposed building elements brick wall wood beams etc were a very nice touch bed was super comfy with excellent linens room was large for big city standards and overall very comfortable we would certainly recommend this hotel as well as stay here on our next visit although there are other nice looking kimpton properties in sf that look fun as well,tripadvisor
1118,it is a nice hotel friendly staff and great location i would recommend this hotel for business or personal stays location is convenient to attractions and great restaurants and the front desk personnel were very accommodating,tripadvisor
1119,we stayed for a second time in this historic in american terms hotel quirky maritime theme may not suit all tastes but the room was large with a view of the golden gate bridge staff were very friendly and helpful spent all day on a wine tasting tour and returning to find free wine being served by the fire was a nice touch as was the free bottle presented in the room when they found out we were celebrating a birthday far better than the usual corporate fair in sf,tripadvisor
1120,the location was great the staff were very helpful and the room was also very nice i was amazed with how quiet the rooms were at night we slept great the water pressure was good and we never ran out of hot water the amenities were nice including the attached restaurant and the games and comfortable chairs in the lobby we never utilized the concierge service but it was available just a great experience and we would definitely stay here again in the future,tripadvisor
1121,the argonaut is charming loved the old bones of the building and our room was huge the location is great for walking to wharf attractions and accessing public transportation we also enjoyed the free bike rental,tripadvisor
1122,this is a fantastic hotel very friendly staff the wine tasting gave everyone a chance to interact rooms very clean and comfortable our deluxe room with a view of the golden gate bridge was better than we had expected the only let down was the mermaid chowder restaurantthe food was served on cold plates and was cold when it arrived at the table,tripadvisor
1123,i did not stay in here but used the lobby and i loved this hotel this was my second option and only second as lots of people say dont stay at fishermans warf but next time i visit san francisco this is the place ill be amazing location beautiful hotel dont know the rooms but im sure its great cable car station ghiradelli is next door,tripadvisor
1124,the hotel was very nice very clean the staff were greatthe only issue was you can litterly hear the next door talking and tv the house keeping lady was very nice and took care of our room front desk was very nice and helpfulalso they have a great valet team they were very polite and help me in and out of my wheelchair,tripadvisor
1125,not only is this hotel located in a great area for touring the wharf city the bed was hands down the most comfortable i have ever found in a hotel like sleeping on a cloud fabulous staff from housekeeping to front desk to bellman all very helpful friendly i will definitely be staying here again,tripadvisor
1126,its located on the end of crazy the very busy touristy pier strip of fishermans wharf its a brick four story building located right next to the cable car hyde street its a walking distance to many attractions restaurants fort masonetc the lobby and the overall decor is very nautical beautiful and fitting with the surrounding they have a restaurant and a wine tasting room the staff was friendly and helpful the walls are thick and the brick structure does the trick its very quiet despite the busy location free wifi,tripadvisor
1127,great location at the warf in walking distance to ghiridelli square boudin tons of restaurants and shopping the cable cars friendly staff and very helpful bed is comfy with a relaxing spacious shower with all the upscale amenities,tripadvisor
1128,we recently stayed in a king bayview room which looked out directly at alcatraz the hotel was great the staff was wonderful and we had the best time exploring the city this location is an easy walk to ghirardelli square and the piers but we managed to walk to north beach chinatown and the embarcco as well,tripadvisor
1129,we really enjoyed our stay at the argonaut the staff were very professional polite and welcoming and made us feel really special the rooms are nice in a themey kind of way but a little dark and the bathrooms were very underwhelming also under the television where the mini bar area is was very dirty so maybe housekeeping could be a little more attentive the location is on the edge of the fishermans wharf area so its easy to avoid the chaos like i said in the title of this review this is a solid hotel over priced in my opinion but a safe bet in the fishermans wharf area particularly loved the infused water in the foyer,tripadvisor
1130,we stayed at the argonaut for 2 nights the location is excellent our room had a lovely view of the golden gate bridge and the cable car turn around the hotel is an old factory the brick and exposed beams were beautiful the only negative was an added fee for things we had no interest in using i was not told of the fee at checking when i enquired the next day the clerk wouldnt remove it from the pervious night but didnt charge us for the second night,tripadvisor
1131,we reserved two adjoining rooms they were each unique and beautiful good size rooms for downtown san francisco the decor in this hotel is gorgeous down to the smallest detail and it seemed new as there was no wear and tear we had a beautiful view of the bay everyone was very friendly too,tripadvisor
1132,my husband and i recently stayed here for an anniversarybirthday trip and had such a wonderful time the area was great but the cable car and street cars stops were such a short walk from the property that we were able to explore other areas of the city as well the public transportation system is a breeze but the concierge will help you out if you have any questions special thanks to steven at check in chuck in housekeeping and richard and vuk y at the blue mermaid for making our trip so memorable,tripadvisor
1133,lovely hotel right on fishermans wharf quiet luxury hotel with great bar restaurant the wharf is definitely aimed at tourists so youll pay more but if you want to spend time on the wharf access the various piers close to cable car stops and hop on tour buses this hotel is great,tripadvisor
1134,this was a great hotel far end of all the piers and wharfs where we like eating but that was ok still plenty of shops and things to bop into around the hotel also we truly were in the hotel from just after a late dinner to check out for the flight home so cant comment on a lot of the ammenities but i did like the place and certainly would look to book again should the need to stay in san francisco arise,tripadvisor
1135,the best location on fishermans wharf walk along the pier and close to restaurants i was pleased with the cleanliness of the hotel i pay close attention to little things like the grout in the bathroom it was spotless plenty of space on the room for four of us would definitely choose to stay here again,tripadvisor
1136,excellent location super helpful and friendly staff easy walking to golden gate bridge pier 39 and beyond bedroom and bed very comfy no tea just coffee provided interior view means everyone elses shutters but theyre all white wooden ones so look good blue mermaid restaurant does delicious breakfast but a little pricey we paid 62 for the 2 of us however they are big portions and lots of great coffee refills really enjoyed our 2 might stay an route to new zealand from the uk,tripadvisor
1137,i stayed here with my mum back in march for my birthday as a short getaway from the moment we checked in the hotel team were friendly and very welcoming the hotel has a very unique looking design which fits in with its location in fishermans wharf the location is great for going out sight seeing and very close to public transport including the old style trams i cant compliment the hotel team enough they knew it was my birthday and laid out a few surprises which were lovely,tripadvisor
1138,the argonaut is in a great location it is slightly away from the main touristy area of pier 39 but still not too far away the building itself is beautiful and the nautical theme is nice the staff are all extremely professional and helpful from reception the door people and the cleaning people a warm hello from the cleaning people is always a great touch also the room was as expected of a high standard and most of all the bed was comfortable gone are the days when i can sleep on any kind of bed and my back appreciated the firmness of the mattress it wasnt too firm it was just perfect we had breakfast at the hotel which was very nice but for a more all singing all dancing kind of a breakfast id recommend the hollywood cafe on north point street we went on quite a few tours during our time in san francisco our favourites were out to visit the coastal redwoods at muir woods and of course alcatraz island dont forget the 5 all day vintage street car pass,tripadvisor
1139,hotel has the wow factor when you arrive and the continued all the way to your room we had a wharf view room and was well worth the extra cost to soak up the atmosphere the room had everything you could want breakfast was a bit pricey but thats a choice thing great location cable car stop literal 2 minutes away lots of shops and restaurants close to ferry for alcatraz and the sea lions absolutely loved this hotel and san francisco,tripadvisor
1140,the argonaut is in a great location in fishermans wharf the rooms are wellappointed spacious and nicely styled in the nautical theme but if you stay here dont go to the bar we were seated at the bar to get a drink waited 15 minutes without even being acknowledged by the bartender and then left to have a predinner drink at our restaurant instead during this time multiple customers had to walk to the bar to request their checks not great when one of the justifications for the resortservice fee is a 10 bar credit,tripadvisor
1141,we will definitely be staying here again we loved the hotel the staff was incredible and went above and beyond for us the location is perfect and we felt very safe at our hotel the hotel and room was very clean and well kept this will be our go to when we visit sf,tripadvisor
1142,we enjoyed a one night getaway at the argonaut and loved every minute of it the location was fabulous and so were the nautical themed rooms would definitely recommend staying her with families and enjoy the view from the starboard side of the hotel,tripadvisor
1143,stay was great the room and location to lots of great things was amazing the staff was very friendly would definitely stay here again only issue is parking so expensive 5075 a day and thats not even if you want to go in and out other than that very nice,tripadvisor
