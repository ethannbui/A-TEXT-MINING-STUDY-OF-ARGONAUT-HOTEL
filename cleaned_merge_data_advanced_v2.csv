The elevator was down 2 out of our 3 nights. The staff was not friendly, nor welcoming. They also did not help us with navigating around the city, no tips, no advice, no help with direction.

17,"When we first entered our room, we immediately noticed blood on the outside of the toilet bowl. We called for housekeeping, but no one showed up. After calling again, they sent an engineer - despite me clearly stating there was blood that needed to be cleaned, not a plumbing issue. The engineer left to find a cleaner, and when that person finally arrived, they didn't even clean the bloody area.
My wife is a registered nurse, and seeing unidentified blood in what should be a clean, sterile environment was deeply upsetting. She understands the serious risks of bloodborne pathogens like HIV, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C, and was honestly disturbed that proper sanitation protocols were not folowed. She made it very clear that under OSHA and health safety standards, this kind of contamination is unacceptable and potentially hazardous. We ended up using the lobby restroom instead of the one in our room. On our way out to dinner, we spoke in person to the front desk, explained exactly what happened, and were assured the issue would be resolved before our return. But when we got back hours later, the blood was still there. This experience  left us feeling extremely  uncomfortable and ignored. For a hotel of this standard, this was a major failure in both cleanliness and responsiveness.
Update: The hotel publicly replied, stating they've already ""reached out to me directly"" to address my concerns , but no one has contacted me. I have not received a phone call, email, or message from management. This adds to my frustration, as it feels like they are more focused on
appearances than genuinely addressing guest experiences.","when we first entered our room, we immediately noticed blood on the outside of the toilet bowl. we called for housekeeping, but no one showed up. after calling again, they sent an engineer - despite me clearly stating there was blood that needed to be cleaned, not a plumbing issue. the engineer left to find a cleaner, and when that person finally arrived, they didn't even clean the bloody area.

18,"The room was great, spacious and beautiful.
However we were offered a “$75 upgrade to the bay view, with a $50 credit to their restaurant”. We happily accepted, and at no point did anyone clarify the upgrade was $75/day, and we did not confirm the total price of the upgrade either. We ended up paying 100s of extra dollars that we had not budgeted for.

When checking out we tried to clarify that we were told the upgrade was $75 flat and they said that’s not how their upgrades work and there’s nothing they can do to correct this misleading offer.

We really enjoyed our stay but we felt this “promotion” was quite predatory, so watch out for the offers they make.","the room was great, spacious and beautiful.

This was my second time staying at this hotel in the past 10 years, and it still has its charm. The location in Fisherman’s Wharf is perfect,convenient and scenic. The reception staff were relatively friendly, though they seemed a bit overwhelmed at times.

The room was spacious and featured a very comfortable king-size bed, which made for a great night’s sleep. While the bathroom felt quite dated and the shower pressure was underwhelming, everything was clean and well-maintained.

34,"This hotel ended up being better than I thought. If you're a super light sleeper like I am, you may have issues unless you get a ""courtyard"" room (just inner walls & a couple plants.) My room was on the street but on the very backside of the hotel. Day time was still noisy but night was quiet enough. Beds/ pillows sup comfy. Inside dark/ no natural light but nice & clean. Only had drinks at the restaurant & they were so bad we sent them back. Didn't try the food. This was disappointing. ALL employees were nice & helpful. BUT our stay was tainted by a BUNCH of sneaky & undisclosed extra fees. They advertise valet parking as $75/ night (you have no other choice if you have a vehicle.) But when you checkout they charge you a ""tax"" on the valet so it ends up being $85/ night. Just be upfront & honest & say it's $85. Then all the other taxes/ fees also, which isn't necessarily the fault of the hotel. However they double charged us for parking. When we tried to call & discuss both the front desk guy & front desk manager tried to tell us the bill was correct & to just accept it. It was only after we didn't let up that they acknowledged & corrected the mistake. But even the correction they didn't fully refund us. Whether that was an honest accident or another sneaky attempt to extort more money, I'm not sure. They did eventually fix that as well but it required yet another phone call on our end.

36,"My husband and I have been staying at the Argonaut Hotel every year for over 20 years and always get a Bayview room. This year, I tried to make reservations the week of April 28th, and the rates were extremely high. I emailed Argonaut and Tony recommended we select any other week because of an event in the city, and he would provide us with a great rate and a great City View room. When we checked in Steven provided excellent customer service. He also introduced us to the Assistant Front Desk Manager, Stephanie. She welcomed us to the hotel and thanked us for being a returning guest. She also offered to help us with any reservations for future stays. Steven allowed us to have an early check in at no charge.

Would definitely stay again !","the argonaut hotel is in san francisco's fisherman's wharf. as someone who lives nearby, i have not stayed there, but i've heard many positive comments from friends who have. this review looks at the hotel’s history rather than its services.

the hotel is located in the historic haslett warehouse. this warehouse was built between 1907 and 1909 by the california fruit canners association, which later became known as del monte. at one time, it was part of the world's largest fruit and vegetable cannery. architect william mooser designed the building, which features red brick walls and douglas fir beams, reflecting the industrial style of its time.

canning stopped in 1939, and the building was used for various purposes until the national park service took it over in 1978. in 2001, plans were made to turn the warehouse into a boutique hotel. however, in march 2002, a five-alarm fire caused significant damage and delayed the project. i remember that night well. aaron peskin was the district 3 supervisor at the time, representing the fisherman's wharf area. he played a key role in saving the old historic walls from demolition. despite the fire setback, restoration continued, and the argonaut hotel opened in august 2003.

116,"This was our third time coming to this site because of its location near the wharf and our experiences from the past.   We actually like this location because it forces us to walk around to see everything that the wharf area has to offer AND it’s a way to burn off food as you have to walk back to the hotel.
This was our first time bringing our 7 year old daughter as we wanted to share the experience with her.  The staff were nothing short of amazing and went above and beyond to make her feel welcomed.  We had a two queen bed room facing the bay.  This time we got the Alcatraz view and it was great to see my daughter enjoy that view of the bay.   The rooms we get are always clean and fully stocked with what we need….sound proof too.

i came expecting more because of the good reviews, but ultimately, it's a big disappointment.

after seeing mr. tony roumph's response, i actually asked to meet with him (since we were still at the hotel when i had posted the review), especially since his response was so professional, and not at all argumentative. he introduced me to the chef, mr. amod singh. mr. singh was personable and friendly and so willing to create a vegetarian indian meal for us for that evening.

we enjoyed an amazing dinner of dal, rice, and sabji (vegetable) along with a delicious appetizer, pakoras, and finger-licking-good dessert, kheer.

also, regarding the shower, mr. roumph immediately sent a maintenance person to our room to fix the shower handle thing - and it worked perfectly the next morning.

will i go back to the argonaut? yes!!

thank you to mr. roumph and mr. singh for making our trip even more pleasurable.

*****************************************************************

rooms are ok, a bit smaller than expected. the bathroom is old and needs upgrading, but the shower has good water force. the bathroom is very, very small, one sink, barely any room to put toiletries.
**

After seeing Mr. Tony Roumph's response, I actually asked to meet with him (since we were still at the hotel when I had posted the review), especially since his response was so professional, and not at all argumentative. He introduced me to the chef, Mr. Amod Singh. Mr. Singh was personable and friendly and so willing to create a vegetarian Indian meal for us for that evening.

We enjoyed an amazing dinner of dal, rice, and sabji (vegetable) along with a delicious appetizer, pakoras, and finger-licking-good dessert, kheer.

Also, regarding the shower, Mr. Roumph immediately sent a maintenance person to our room to fix the shower handle thing - and it worked perfectly the next morning.

Will I go back to the Argonaut? YES!!

Thank you to Mr. Roumph and Mr. Singh for making our trip even more pleasurable.

476,"we were a group that stayed at this hotel for a work function. initially, the hotel was pretty standard but it was in a good location close to the local sights. the hotel staff was also okay, middle of the road. the reason why i'm giving them one star is because they charged every room minibar fees when none of us used the minibar. when you are travelling for work, you know that your company does not pay for such inflated charges, especially when all meals are planned and prepaid. none of us even knew at the time because we only received the bill under the door that of course didn't include these fees. they never sent us the final bills with these charges. the only way we found out was when we received the credit card statements a month later. i'd understand making an honest mistake for one room, but there were five rooms that were affected by this fraud. this really seems like they make it a regular practice to add minibar fees regardless of it they were actually used. usually we try to stay away from boutique hotels, but thought we'd give this one a shot since they were slightly lower than other. sorry to say we got what we paid for. never going back",the argonaut hotel is a beautiful brown stone corner building building next to the shops and eateries of the del monte cannery building. luxurious hotel with impeccable hospitality and sincerely helpful staff.,yelp,argonaut beautiful brown stone corner building building next shop eatery del monte cannery building luxurious impeccable hospitality sincerely helpful staff,Positive,Excellent Location & Nearby Attractions

546,"""boutique hotel"" sure has become a superfluous title thrown around these days... it's really just a way to jack up the pricing for literally everything, with little support to back it up when there's a problem. i won't spend too much time reiterating what others have said: thin walls, so you hear what's going on around you, the ""prison yard"" esque view of the inside rooms (good one, reviewer), the toilet paper holder beyond reach of the toilet (at least my room did have an extra roll on the back of the toilet), a bed that's rock hard but pillows that are so soft they really can't be called pillows because your head shouldn't be allowed to meld with the mattress when using pillows, etc. upon check-in, the front desk agent gave me a key to the mini bar in case i wanted to refrigerate any of my own stuff. when i got into my room, i noticed it was already unlocked. i flagged this with the desk because i have not consumed anything and will not be paying for it if they try and tell me i have upon checkout. $100/night ""hold"" for incidentals is ludicrous. as if i'm going to run out of here with the $49 umbrella, $26 small bottle of wine, $14 stuffed plush seal, and the $3.25 two ounce bag of cheetos and not pay for any of it. this is why you keep the card on file, you don't preemptively run a charge for each night. my room has a mirror facing the bed. any designer worth their salt should tell you this is bad feng shui, whether you prescribe to that line of thinking or not, it's just bad practice for sleeping arrangements. sex room/dungeon, okay sure, but just sleeping not so much. my biggest gripe comes from a tech standpoint. i'm in town for a conference, thus need reliable wifi to do work. my first day in, i successfully purchase the $14.95/day upgrade to connect up to three devices - and all worked smoothly. by the time i returned to hotel next day, upgrade expired so i attempted to purchase another. my laptop browser would not automatically open the webpage to allow this. now, being a tech savvy person, i know how to troubleshoot the basics. forget the wifi and try again, clear my browser cache, see if the page auto-loads in another browser, restart the computer. funnily enough, i was able to purchase the upgrade on my phone, but still couldn't get my laptop to open the damn page. so, of course i call front desk to ask for the website that should be loading so i can load it manually. if the way the site recognizes you is to enter your room number and last name, *it should be accessible manually*. front desk person was nice enough, but clueless. she put me on hold to talk to someone else who told me to try all the things above again. thanks but no thanks. tried everything 10+ times already. nada. as i type this i'm still on the slow-as-molasses free wifi that says you get 5mb speeds, but i've never broken 2.6mb the entire time. thankfully it's just fast enough to put in this critical review. management: get your staff educated on the website to enter for manual connection to the paid wifi. this is an option, as i've done so at other hotels. i probably won't be staying here again, but i can't be the only person this has happened to and felt it worth noting for others in town for work and not tourism.","loved this hotel. there was a doorman so no one in lobby that shouldn't be. very clean, big rooms, great hotel restaurant, etc. considering it was in the wharf it was quite at night. for sure tourists area but safe and you can walk everywhere",yelp,loved doorman one lobby shouldnt clean big great restaurant etc considering wharf quite night sure tourist area safe walk everywhere,Positive,Excellent Location & Nearby Attractions

560,"my sister and i stayed here for the weekend and i told my boyfriend that when he and i come back to san francisco that we would have to stay here again. to be honest, the room wasn't the greatest. the whole ambiance of the hotel was comforting; it had a rustic nautical theme, and the decor was really cute. the hotel room just could have been nicer, like they could do a little updating. however, it was pretty clean so i'm not complaining there, i just wish they offered hand soap at this hotel! it's the only hotel i've ever been to that doesn't provide any hand soap. the best thing about this hotel though, is the location. i love being on the wharf so close to everything. it can still take a little while to get where you want to go, even on the wharf, but if you don't mind a 30 minute or so walk then it's not a big deal. i personally like to walk and enjoy being able to explore the neighborhood. one thing that does bother me about san francisco that i'm not sure whether or not gets enough attention (and i've noticed this even in the tourist parts of the city) is the homelessness issue. it saddens me to see all of the homeless people that are around the city. i woke up twice in the morning on my last day here to homeless people outside of our window. it's a pretty pricey place (san francisco), and it doesn't seem like the neighborhoods (nor the people) are being taken care of. it's easy to blame homelessness on drugs, laziness, etc., but in a city that's so expensive ($2500+ to rent a studio) and has more than enough money to do something about the issue, it saddens me. the city is also pretty messy, there is trash everywhere, so i loved that this hotel seemed to be so clean, because i'm not sure i'd feel comfortable staying anywhere else! i do recommend visiting san francisco and giving this hotel a try. this hotel will make your trip because of the convenience of the location.","lovely hotel with tasteful sailor inspired interior. the location close to the piers was perfect for us. when booking we got excellent service at the front desk from ms mari carmen, who also made sure that our needs were taken care of upon arrival. we did not have time to lunch nor dine at the hotel, and therefore we shall not be able review the restaurant.",yelp,lovely tasteful sailor inspired interior location close pier perfect u booking got excellent service front desk m mari carmen also made sure need taken care upon arrival time lunch dine therefore shall able review restaurant,Positive,Excellent Location & Nearby Attractions

595,"i do not understand why this hotel has such high ratings. the beds were very firm and not great. the pillows were insanely soft and weird to have with the firm mattress. i asked about whether they had other mattresses and was told no, but they'd call me back to discuss solutions. no one ever called back. we were there for 4 days for my husband to convalesce from some minor surgery so the uncomfortable beds were a pretty significant inconvenience. we didn't need housekeeping for a couple of days but asked for fresh towels. that also did not happen. i really didn't feel the hotel staff had any concerns for us as guests. definitely not a high quality customer service situation, sadly. definitely not worthy of over $1,000 for our 4 day stay. my other major complaint is that the windows have wooden shutters which don't fully close and yet there are lights all around the outside. this meant the room was never completely dark and i found it hard to get to sleep. a minor complaint is that the volume of the tv kept fading in and out irregularly. it wasn't too frequent but the general lack of responsiveness from the hotel staff didn't inspire me to believe they'd fix it promptly- if ever so i didn't bother to request service. there was no market or grocery store terribly close. trader joe's was about a 15 minute walk away so not bad, but not ideal. the restaurants nearby were a mixed bag, but it's a very touristy area so i didn't have high hopes. we could hear yelling in the street on a daily basis and given that the 4th floor we were on was the highest, i imagine all the rooms can hear street sounds too. i wouldn't return here ever nor would i ever recommend it to anyone either.","eh, we have mixed feelings about argonaut. it's a cute hotel in a superb location but, unfortunately, some things were lacking. we were going to on our mini honeymoon and wanted to stay somewhere pleasant and romantic. based on good reviews, we thought argonaut would be an appropriate choice. we booked online and i called to mention that it was our honeymoon and asked whether it was possible for them to do something nice for us. perhaps a room with a pleasant view? i don't know, sometimes hotels do nice things for their guests on special occasions. well, the lady on the phone couldn't care less about our honeymoon. she responded that we had to pay more for a room with a view. ok, that makes sense, but perhaps she could sound less annoyed with our request? or at least she could try looking into what was available and let us know? so, we arrive at the hotel and find a bottle of wine with a greeting card - very nice of them, thank you, argonaut! however, the room is absolutely tiny and shares a thin wall with the room next door. so thin that we could hear every word of a phone conversation next door. our neighbor wasn't even loud. that wall was paper thin. we immediately regretted our choice. certainly not honeymoon-appropriate. the view was terrible as well. our windows were facing other hotel windows into the courtyard. i guess we did have to pay extra for something bigger, better, and more private, perhaps somewhere a bit more accommodating to our special request.",yelp,eh mixed feeling argonaut cute superb location unfortunately thing lacking going mini honeymoon wanted somewhere pleasant romantic based good review thought argonaut would appropriate choice booked online called mention honeymoon asked whether possible something nice u perhaps pleasant view dont know sometimes hotel nice thing guest special occasion well lady phone couldnt care less honeymoon responded pay view ok make sense perhaps could sound less annoyed request least could try looking available let u know arrive find bottle wine greeting card nice thank argonaut however absolutely tiny share thin wall next door thin could hear every word phone conversation next door neighbor wasnt even loud wall paper thin immediately regretted choice certainly honeymoonappropriate view terrible well window facing window courtyard guess pay extra something bigger better private perhaps somewhere bit accommodating special request,Positive,Friendly Staff & Exceptional Service

618,"eh, we have mixed feelings about argonaut. it's a cute hotel in a superb location but, unfortunately, some things were lacking. we were going to on our mini honeymoon and wanted to stay somewhere pleasant and romantic. based on good reviews, we thought argonaut would be an appropriate choice. we booked online and i called to mention that it was our honeymoon and asked whether it was possible for them to do something nice for us. perhaps a room with a pleasant view? i don't know, sometimes hotels do nice things for their guests on special occasions. well, the lady on the phone couldn't care less about our honeymoon. she responded that we had to pay more for a room with a view. ok, that makes sense, but perhaps she could sound less annoyed with our request? or at least she could try looking into what was available and let us know? so, we arrive at the hotel and find a bottle of wine with a greeting card - very nice of them, thank you, argonaut! however, the room is absolutely tiny and shares a thin wall with the room next door. so thin that we could hear every word of a phone conversation next door. our neighbor wasn't even loud. that wall was paper thin. we immediately regretted our choice. certainly not honeymoon-appropriate. the view was terrible as well. our windows were facing other hotel windows into the courtyard. i guess we did have to pay extra for something bigger, better, and more private, perhaps somewhere a bit more accommodating to our special request.","we decided to go to hawaii for our honeymoon and my wife planned her dream vacation. we thought it would be a long commute from the philadelphia area, so we should cut our flight in half and stop by san francisco for a few days before we reach hawaii. i took it upon myself to surprise my wife and found what i thought would be a great hotel, the argonaut, near the wharf. when we arrived, our room wasn't ready and the front desk clerk was extremely friendly. she assured us that they had a perfect room for us on the top floor as requested and it would just be a bit longer. we decided to walk around the city for a bit and when we got back to the hotel our ""room"" was finally ready. we were given keys to the third floor though. i tried to inquire why, but they assured me that was the room they had for us. waiting in our room was a nice bottle of champagne and candy from ghirardelli. there was a card wishing us a happy honeymoon, but on the back of the card was a three digit number starting with 4, so i'm assuming that was the room we were supposed to have. the room looked similar to the photos of the room we wanted, so who really cared? we were on our honeymoon. in the room, a lamp didn't work and the television wasn't plugged in. we had the light fixed quickly and i plugged the television in myself. the hotel had a nice happy hour, where we could grab some free beer and wine. most of the staff were incredibly friendly until after we checked out and i had to contact them. my wife knows the daughter of a woman at her work and she lives in the san francisco area. this woman personally dropped off a gift basket/wedding gift at the hotel. we didn't find this out until we were in hawaii and the woman asked if we received the gift. i still had the card with the other room number, so i contacted the hotel to see if they had the gift and possibly delivered it to our original room. the hotel told me that they didn't have the gift and they were pretty cold to me. i emailed and tried contacting them again to get a hold of another person who could possibly help me and no one could. the manager tried to cover it up by saying they weren't sure why we were moved, but they wouldn't have delivered anything if we weren't in the room. as i mentioned in my final email to them: although our stay wasn't bad, we are put in the position where we have to decide if a close friend, who asked us if we got the gift she personally delivered to the hotel to surprise us with, lied to us or if someone at the hotel kept the gift for themselves. update: our stay was prior to the argonaut being taken over by a new ownership group. i have been contacted by a representative from the new company and he has assured me that there are a lot of new employees. i have no way of knowing if the employees we had issues with are still there or not. i have been assured that our experience would be better the next time, but we still have no desire to return. i have also been told that the happy hour that we enjoyed is no longer available. when i inquired what replaced that, i was basically told to experience it for myself and to contact them for the best rates. that's not a great selling point to me, so i'm not sure if there is anything that special there other than the great location.",yelp,decided go hawaii honeymoon wife planned dream vacation thought would long commute philadelphia area cut flight half stop san francisco day reach hawaii took upon surprise wife found thought would great argonaut near wharf arrived wasnt ready front desk clerk extremely friendly assured u perfect u top floor requested would bit longer decided walk around city bit got back finally ready given key third floor though tried inquire assured u waiting nice bottle champagne candy ghirardelli card wishing u happy honeymoon back card three digit number starting im assuming supposed looked similar photo wanted really cared honeymoon lamp didnt work television wasnt plugged light fixed quickly plugged television nice happy hour could grab free beer wine staff incredibly friendly checked contact wife know daughter woman work life san francisco area woman personally dropped gift basketwedding gift didnt find hawaii woman asked received gift still card number contacted see gift possibly delivered original told didnt gift pretty cold emailed tried contacting get hold another person could possibly help one could manager tried cover saying werent sure moved wouldnt delivered anything werent mentioned final email although wasnt bad put position decide close friend asked u got gift personally delivered surprise u lied u someone kept gift update prior argonaut taken new ownership group contacted representative new company assured lot new employee way knowing employee issue still assured experience would better next time still desire return also told happy hour enjoyed longer available inquired replaced basically told experience contact best rate thats great selling point im sure anything special great location,Positive,Friendly Staff & Exceptional Service

622,wonderful stay! great location! so convenient to everything in the city yet you feel a bit removed from the tourist scene once you step inside. our room was quiet and had a decent view of the courtyard in the cannery. the beds were comfortable and everything was so clean! my only complaint is that the pressure from the shower head is very weak. i figured we were in ca and there was still a drought so i got used to the shower pressure. we enjoyed breakfast at the blue mermaid- service was good there as well. kinda expensive but you have to remember you are in the middle of the tourist area. the hotel gives you a $10 voucher to eat daily there. the cheapest thing on the menu for breakfast is a bagel for $6. coffee is $5. the cost of the hotel was worth the pleasant three night stay in sf. word of advice if you want to save $ during the trip would be to take the muni. the f trolley goes along embarcadero and the 30 stockton goes straight into the heart of chinatown. the 30 bus experience was like an amusement park ride.... (crazy city bus driver trying to keep up with her bus schedule.... ). sf has a great transit system. you get to feel like a local and it's a way better deal than the tourist trap cable car.... $7 versus $2.75. the muni even gives you extra minutes to ride back. on one of our trips we got a return ride included after 4 hours after our initial departure. sweet deal! another money saving tip is to rent a car from sfo and drop it off by closing to the rental agency nearby. we rented from avis and paid only $16 to rent an suv. we arrived early in the morning and drove down to palo alto and returned the car a block away from the hotel by 5pm. parking and driving in the city is so not worth your time or money.,"my husband and i love this hotel we got engaged at this hotel about 2 years ago so we can't see ourselves staying anywhere else. we just stayed here again his weekend and it was what we remembered from our fond memories. from the outside service to the front desk, the service is impeccable. they are all very friendly, accommodating and professional. my husband spoils me so we stay in the suite with the hot tub and love love love it! the room is extremely nice and we feel right at home when we come here. the best part is is the hotel is located within walking distance to fisherman's wharf which we love. i highly recommend staying here.",yelp,husband love got engaged year ago cant see staying anywhere else stayed weekend remembered fond memory outside service front desk service impeccable friendly accommodating professional husband spoil suite hot tub love love love extremely nice feel right home come best part located within walking distance fisherman wharf love highly recommend staying,Positive,Scenic Views & Hotel Aesthetic

632,"ive found my new replacement to the fairmont hotel. this hotel was unbelievable. i didn't come here to be a tourist of fishermans wharf. i just had always wanted to check out this hotel and i was finally able to. we booked the king suite. one of the most beautiful, comfortable suites ive ever stayed in. better than any suite ive had at the fairmont chain. it over looked a corner of the wharf, which we opened the window up most of the time to the enchanting bay air. the suite had a huge living room with a door that closed to the bedroom that was also giant. the bathroom was also expansive. the bathtub was incredible. its huge. a family of four could comfortably sit in it and actually swim. i couldn't stay out of it. i got in in the middle of the night and i got in as soon as i woke up. i couldn't get enough of this bathtub. i lounged around in my complimentary robe every second i could. the bed was very comfortable. i loved the bedding set. everything was just perfect. going back to the fairmont comparison, this giant suite was $200 cheaper than a regular room at the fairmont. can you believe that?! its so worth it if you can do it. the hotel is wonderful. service is fast and efficient. there are obviously lots of things within walking distance. we walked down by the beach, we walked and got brunch the next day. this hotel has become my happy place every time i reminisce about my stay.","i've been coming to the argonaut for years, in fact i got married here! they have always been super friendly and accommodating. they love our dogs and always give them treats! the front desk always makes sure i get the room we love. the hotel itself is located in an old canning factory. it's gorgeous and they gave it a sophisticated nautical feel. plus, it's always spotless. rates have always been very reasonable. it changed hands recently and now noble house runs it. it's exactly the same, maybe even slightly better! book a room here. you will be thrilled!",yelp,ive coming argonaut year fact got married always super friendly accommodating love dog always give treat front desk always make sure get love located old canning factory gorgeous gave sophisticated nautical feel plus always spotless rate always reasonable changed hand recently noble house run exactly maybe even slightly better book thrilled,Positive,Friendly Staff & Exceptional Service
633,"i have stayed in many san franciscan hotels but i think the argonaut may be my favorite. i have always been intrigued and when a good deal presented itself i bit. i was so excited for months and once we arrived it was better than i dreamed. before we walked into the hotel, the doorman was loading our stuff onto a cart and welcoming us. we were very early and didn't expect our room to be ready but marilyn? checked us in and found us a wonderful room with an amazing view. such a small action made such a difference in our vacation because we were able to get settled and enjoy our hotel that much longer, thanks to her. she was super sweet and i can tell she rolls out the red carpet for everyone she helps. the rooms are huge and even have doorbells! the service by all staff members was exceptional and felt like a family environment. the doormen and bell hops seems to genuinely enjoy being at work. we loved the lobby with its fireplace and with complementary citrus infused water. the location is fantastic in touristy fisherman's wharf. if tourist traps aren't your thing, that's ok, the cable car or bus stop is close by and can quickly whisk you away to less visited areas of town, as we prefer to do. one of my favorite things to do when visiting is ride the cable cars at night for stunning views of the city and shorter lines. it was so nice to be staying close to the line. i will most likely stay here again.","this was one of the best hotel experiences i have ever had! upon arriving in mid afternoon in the hustle and bustle of fisherman's wharf, we were a bit flustered with traffic and where to park. when we pulled out in front of the hotel, the staff instantly warmly greeted us and gave us directions on where to park. although they do offer valet parking for $50 per night, we opted to self park behind the hotel (that is not affiliated with the hotel). they grabbed our luggage for us while we parked which helped us from lugging all our heavy baggage across the street. check-in was easy, and we were amazed by our nautical themed room. it was very spacious, clean, and beautifully decorated. we were stunned that every room even had their own doorbell! the lobby was also cozy with a fireplace, plenty of sitting room, and had an attached restaurant. although we did not eat at the restaurant, the menu looked appetizing and it was nice to know it was a place we could go to for a snack if needed. we loved this hotel not only for the ambience, but also because it is in the best location in fisherman's wharf. unfortunately, the location is probably why it was on the pricer end. it is located right on the main street across from the piers between ghirardelli square and all the wharf's shops/restaurants, so you have easy access to eating and entertainment without taking transportation. we were sad to leave this hotel, but we will be back!",yelp,one best experience ever upon arriving mid afternoon hustle bustle fisherman wharf bit flustered traffic park pulled front staff instantly warmly greeted u gave u direction park although offer valet parking per night opted self park behind affiliated grabbed luggage u parked helped u lugging heavy baggage across street checkin easy amazed nautical themed spacious clean beautifully decorated stunned every even doorbell lobby also cozy fireplace plenty sitting attached restaurant although eat restaurant menu looked appetizing nice know place could go snack needed loved ambience also best location fisherman wharf unfortunately location probably pricer end located right main street across pier ghirardelli square wharf shopsrestaurants easy access eating entertainment without taking transportation sad leave back,Positive,Excellent Location & Nearby Attractions

641,"we decided to go to hawaii for our honeymoon and my wife planned her dream vacation. we thought it would be a long commute from the philadelphia area, so we should cut our flight in half and stop by san francisco for a few days before we reach hawaii. i took it upon myself to surprise my wife and found what i thought would be a great hotel, the argonaut, near the wharf. when we arrived, our room wasn't ready and the front desk clerk was extremely friendly. she assured us that they had a perfect room for us on the top floor as requested and it would just be a bit longer. we decided to walk around the city for a bit and when we got back to the hotel our ""room"" was finally ready. we were given keys to the third floor though. i tried to inquire why, but they assured me that was the room they had for us. waiting in our room was a nice bottle of champagne and candy from ghirardelli. there was a card wishing us a happy honeymoon, but on the back of the card was a three digit number starting with 4, so i'm assuming that was the room we were supposed to have. the room looked similar to the photos of the room we wanted, so who really cared? we were on our honeymoon. in the room, a lamp didn't work and the television wasn't plugged in. we had the light fixed quickly and i plugged the television in myself. the hotel had a nice happy hour, where we could grab some free beer and wine. most of the staff were incredibly friendly until after we checked out and i had to contact them. my wife knows the daughter of a woman at her work and she lives in the san francisco area. this woman personally dropped off a gift basket/wedding gift at the hotel. we didn't find this out until we were in hawaii and the woman asked if we received the gift. i still had the card with the other room number, so i contacted the hotel to see if they had the gift and possibly delivered it to our original room. the hotel told me that they didn't have the gift and they were pretty cold to me. i emailed and tried contacting them again to get a hold of another person who could possibly help me and no one could. the manager tried to cover it up by saying they weren't sure why we were moved, but they wouldn't have delivered anything if we weren't in the room. as i mentioned in my final email to them: although our stay wasn't bad, we are put in the position where we have to decide if a close friend, who asked us if we got the gift she personally delivered to the hotel to surprise us with, lied to us or if someone at the hotel kept the gift for themselves. update: our stay was prior to the argonaut being taken over by a new ownership group. i have been contacted by a representative from the new company and he has assured me that there are a lot of new employees. i have no way of knowing if the employees we had issues with are still there or not. i have been assured that our experience would be better the next time, but we still have no desire to return. i have also been told that the happy hour that we enjoyed is no longer available. when i inquired what replaced that, i was basically told to experience it for myself and to contact them for the best rates. that's not a great selling point to me, so i'm not sure if there is anything that special there other than the great location.","although the location is supremely ideal, the valet parking is a long wait, and is overall not a good price for what you get.",yelp,although location supremely ideal valet parking long wait overall good price get,Positive,Parking & Service Concerns

652,"so i've stayed here a number of times. it's a nice hotel but i'm 2 starring it because of the pretentious bs. i've booked rooms from their website and from discount sites. the regular rooms are great. they keep what i can only assume are rooms for chumps who rent on third party websites. here's my experience today. i'm driving into the city from work so i can catch a flight tomorrow. i check their website and the discount sites. discount sites are 50$ cheaper. out of courtesy because i like the hotel, i call them direct and see if they will honor the rate i found on every other third party site. the lady who answers checks her third party rates and claims she doesn't see the same and declines to match. i triple checked to make sure all of the sites had the same. she makes no counter offer for what she allegedly sees. so i say thank you and book thru a third party. this is the second time i've done this and they have done this. the hotel has no idea who i am. i arrive and a new guy checks me in. he's gracious polite and efficient. i head to the room. yup they shoved me all the way in the back, and it's a long slog from the elevators. which would be ok if the room weren't a deliberately under-furnished pos. the other rooms have a lovely couch and desk arrangement. i have the same sized room with a desk and a single tiny sad dirty little chair. there is a giant gap on the wall where the couch should be. and the bathroom has hair in it. plus the bath mat is scummy with mold. so tell me management? how sad is it that you actually keep rooms that you refused to put the normal furniture in and don't maintain as well just for third party bookings? i know the hotel isn't full tonight. i checked the vacancy level. when these guys have their a game on it's nice but they actually train their desk staff to lie. you will actually have a better stay at a hampton or a holiday inn.",great staff amenities the lobby is cool the rooms offer nice decor with red brick walls and a large bed we had a view overlooking the bay street and the room was quiet with the traffic below would recommend to others to stay,tripadvisor,great staff amenity lobby cool offer nice decor red brick wall large bed view overlooking bay street quiet traffic would recommend others,Positive,Friendly Staff & Exceptional Service

678,booked the hotel several months ago as part of a 6 week usa trip the rooms and all public areas were kept really clean and all the cleaning staff always had a smile for you the other staff were all very pleasant but there seemed to be some resentment about handling your own bags which i had not come across in the 20 or 25 or so other hotels i had stayed in during our 9 state trip i asked to use a trolley which again have been available in all the other hotels but was told they are only for the bell boys use i dont mind paying for a service but i dont being pushed towards it im sure the management are going to come up with some excuse like health and safety rather than it being a way for staff to make up their low wages the other thing i was not aware of is that it is a pet friendly hotel which in our case meant being woken up 3 morning in a row by the people in the next rooms dog barking the resturant was ok as was the bar but quite costly certainly a great location for the wharf area but that said this was my first time back in 20 years and its not the clean historic place it used to be,extremely thin walls where i could hear the conversation next door perfectly the staff was nice overall a bit expensive for what you get in terms of finishes and views my window looked directly into another room staff was nice,tripadvisor,extremely thin wall could hear conversation next door perfectly staff nice overall bit expensive get term finish view window looked directly another staff nice,Positive,Friendly Staff & Exceptional Service

719,stayed in early oct including the fleet weekend although booked a year ago was given a room on 2nd floor as was told that higher floors given to those only here for a day or two and we could move to a higher floor tomorrow why not just preallocate rooms as a lot easier price very high and aligned to top hotels in london eg the ritz but dont feel you get same level of quality love the sustainability of hotel but toiletries dont feel local nor do the have any aroma of citrus or tea tree feel like they have been in bottle too long why not just put enough in for the stay and keep it fresh also on sustainability why not put free water in rooms charging 5 for evian how is evian in a sf hotel room sustainable i know fresh water in lobby but that in a small jug in each room would have been a bit of a wow rooms are so comfortable and very clean had pillows changed and a little issue with shower was fixed with no fuss the hotel has such friendly charming staff they cant do enough for you just be honest and polite and they are the same back including those who park the cars was the one chance to blow me away with quality as not likely to be back in the bay area for a number of years but sadly it missed the chance it is an amazing location for quality of its staff match the price but sadly not the quality of the hotel,came to san francisco for my daughters august wedding she selected the hotel and i looked it up on the website before visiting im not including any of my photos of the room or lobby because the website very accurately portrays all the details my

856,i attended an international conference in san francisco in december and booked my accommodation very late i would usually have stayed much closer to the central business district or the convention centre eg intercontinental but all of these hotels were already full i was very impressed by the service at the argonaut from the time i arrived until i checked out five nights later the room had quite a quirky nautical theme and was decorated and furnished to a high quality with a really comfortable bed the exposed brickwork at one end of the room was an unusual feature and really suited the dcor the breakfast in the blue mermaid restaurant was average i only ate there on one morning the location is great if you want to be in the centre of the action at fishermans wharf in close proximity to the golden gate bridge alcatraz etc for business it is not quite so convenient i had a number of early morning meetings in other more central hotels eg le meridien and had to get a taxi there and back a small fare 10 usd which seemed to irritate the drivers i would consider staying at the argonaut again if i was travelling for leisure with my family but probably not when i return to san francisco on business due to it being a bit further out than i would like,had a great time this hotel argonaut is excellent in a great place great room trendy bars and reception and very very friendly staff we really did enjoy the hotel and this lovely city 1010 for the hotel david,tripadvisor,great time argonaut excellent great place great trendy bar reception friendly staff really enjoy lovely city david,Positive,Friendly Staff & Exceptional Service

900,the best thing that the argonaut has going for it is the location between ghiradelli square and fishermans wharf its incredibly easy to walk to so many great tourist spots including pier 39 and pier 33 the lobby is lovely with a large fireplace comfy seating and games think upscale connect 4 and tic tac toe our room had a view of the the room across from the courtyard but we were really only there to sleep and we didnt mind also drinks at the fire pit outside at the blue mermaid was a great way to wind down now for the not so great the 25 daily urban resort fee is kind of ridiculous it covers wifi come on and infused water in the lobby which was empty every single time i passed through at least 6 times day next the bathrooms in the rooms are very dated and not laid out exceedingly well the hair dryer hangs on a hook just outside of the shower our shower head made a high pitched squealing noise that we couldnt stop no matter what we tried also prepare for long elevator waits with only 2 slow elevators finally perhaps the most frustrating was the service the representative at check in was flat out rude and also did not disclose the urban facility fee overall there were really great things about the argonaut but really annoying aspects brought the overall experience down great location and if you get a good deal its definitely worth it,the only issue we had was with the air conditioning as soon as we let them know they sent someone right away to get it fixed by the time we came back from shopping it was running great there was never any question or issue with the staff,tripadvisor,issue air conditioning soon let know sent someone right away get fixed time came back shopping running great never question issue staff,Positive,Excellent Location & Nearby Attractions

908,we stayed here for 3 nights for the first part of our honeymoon check in with travis was friendly and fast we got to our room and realised that it was not the deluxe view room that i had booked i called travis and after a few minutes he realised the mistake and we were moved to a lovely room with a view of the golden gate bridge and cable car turnaround i must all mention that in our original room there was some chocolate a bottle of sparkling wine and a card congratulating us on our marriage very thoughtful our stay was good although the hotel was very busy and noisy due to a hm convention one night we were woken around 2am by the room next door there seemed to be about 10 people in one room carrying on their party it took 3 calls to the front desk to get them silenced the hotel is in the best location and kept very clean and tidy we will consider the argonaut when we return to san francisco a note to the hotel when your guests book through a 3rd party please check their vouchers carefully this is what caused our room mix up and when we returned we also realised that we had a continental breakfast included in our rate but this was never mentioned which is a shame,hotel is in great location right on the wharf we rented a car because we were also visiting family on the other side of the bay but id recommend against it as this is a very busy area with lots of pedestrians the location is in the heart of many attractions including ghirardelli lombard street boats to alcatraz and fishermens wharf i love the kimpton hotels for their quirkiness and this was no different appears to be original brickwork in rooms nice deep tub we rented a king suit and it was plenty big for two adults and child now for the negatives the room was oddly shaped and seemed to have a lot of wasted space it was more like one large l shaped room with the end of the l being nothing but the entry way and a small sitting table it was clean but looks like it is ready for a remodel shower door barely opened and closed needs new paint the restaurant food was not good and the restaurant looked like it needed to be cleaned my other issue was with the concierge we had not booked tickets to alcatraz but my daughter wanted to go i asked the concierge and was told to check back the next day and she may have tickets that morning she walked me down to a guy who i figured later was a ticket broker who sent me to another guy where i paid 90 per person for a bay cruise and alcatraz tickets separate tours but i had no choice the face value for each tour was 30 which i didnt realize until after i had paid so basically i had paid an 270 for tours 2 tours for 3 people i could have paid 180 for since the bay tours werent sold out and i could have gotten those at any time i was really paying double to go to alcatraz im not so bothered that i had to pay more than face value since it was my mistake in not booking in advance but did not like that the concierge did not explain to me ahead of time that she was taking me to a broker she simply told me to follow her as if she had some connection to get tickets had i known ahead of time i might have negotiated if negotiation was not an option the concierge should have explained to me the price ahead of time including that it was a markup and made the deal for me minor issue but it kind of bothered me in sum id recommend this hotel if you want to stay in this area but i wouldnt go out of my way to stay there,tripadvisor,great location right wharf rented car also visiting family side bay id recommend busy area lot pedestrian location heart many attraction including ghirardelli lombard street boat alcatraz fishermens wharf love kimpton hotel quirkiness different appears original brickwork nice deep tub rented king suit plenty big two adult child negative oddly shaped seemed lot wasted space like one large shaped end nothing entry way small sitting table clean look like ready remodel shower door barely opened closed need new paint restaurant food good restaurant looked like needed cleaned issue concierge booked ticket alcatraz daughter wanted go asked concierge told check back next day may ticket morning walked guy figured later ticket broker sent another guy paid per person bay cruise alcatraz ticket separate tour choice face value tour didnt realize paid basically paid tour tour people could paid since bay tour werent sold could gotten time really paying double go alcatraz im bothered pay face value since mistake booking advance like concierge explain ahead time taking broker simply told follow connection get ticket known ahead time might negotiated negotiation option concierge explained price ahead time including markup made deal minor issue kind bothered sum id recommend want area wouldnt go way,Positive,Excellent Location & Nearby Attractions

wanted to give the argonaut a try since the rooms looked visually appealing and the reviews were on par with my experiences at other kimptons overall i would actually say that our stay was disappointing for several reasons most on the part of the argonaut the rest on myself disappointing aspects in no specific order the staff i felt it was rather nonexistent aside from the gentlemen working the front door checkin was fine but not overly welcoming this was unusual for a kimpton checkout well even though we stood in line we waited longer since a person just sauntered up to ask questions and the the guest relations representative allowed this to happen my usually experience at a kimpton is you are often greeted warmly throughout your stay and there is a large staff presence in the hotel any other kimpton i have stayed at i would constantly see and be greeted by staff members at all hours of the day this was not the case here the wine hour was packed and seemed to be filled with people who knew about it but were actually not staying at the hotel in fact i often saw people walking away from the hotel with wine glasses this seems like a real liability issue i am not even sure there are people managing the wine hour there was no complimentary or tea or coffee service as you would find at other kimptons in the morning sure there was a coffee maker in the room but in the bathroom and that was uncomfortable at best they probably didnt want to deal with another round of people coming in for the free items logical but not really a kimpton experience the rooms the rooms are visually appealing and spacious but the beds were so hard that we barely slept in hindsight we wish we would have check out and tried another hotel because all of us 3 stayed in one room found we were in pain a week after traveling this is something another guest noted the beds in the double rooms are way too hard i actually prefer a firmer bed but these beds were so hard that one of us actually decided to try sleeping in the arm chair in the room they were that uncomfortable i cant convey how much this impacted our stay and the days after our stay i really felt awful and i am very sorry that i didnt saying anything about it at the time because i paid financially physically and mentally for it cleanliness the room was mostly clean but there were a lot of inconsistencies in the cleaning from day one to day two and three i also found it frustrating that the carpets were not vacuumed daily this seems like basic room service to me i felt there was a disconnect in this area that could be easily managed we left tips daily which were taken but the items we specifically requested more towels floor vacuumed were not provided the restaurant is terrible dont go there are much better places to eat in sf and i highly recommend that you by bypass it at all cost our breakfast was terrible the service was careless and lackadaisical our server actually told us he spaced out while taking our order the food was served cold without any condiments and it was expensive for what you get skip it the location this is my fault i wanted to try something different and get out of downtown but i felt this location was too much on the fringe of everything sure it was within walking distance to many things but they were not things i am that interested in if you want to stay on the wharf note that this is on the fringe of it not the heart of it if you dont want to be in a touristy location with the ding ding ding of the trolley nearby and the hoots and shouts of the duck boats then stay away from this location at all costs it will make you mad while not a big deal the hotel is also fully of families at all hours children were running up and down the halls there are also only two elevators and you often had to wait a short wait not a big deal to get to your room at all hours after thinking about it after the fact i would stay this stay was rather poor if i had to do it all over again i would really consider bringing it up the the management but i checked in on christmas day and i heard them tell someone inquiring about a room that they only had two left i knew it would be fruitless to complain about the beds when there was clearly no comparable room we could be moved to when we left the doorman asked us how our stay was and we mentioned the how terrible the beds were and his response was everyone says that its been a real problem and management is looking into it this actually made everything worse really you know this is a problem but youre just looking into it the really frustrating aspect is that its very hard to find many rooms in the sf area with two queen beds most of the rooms offer only two full beds while this is find for two people its challenging for three adults this was the main reason we selected this hotel because it was important for all of us to be together in the same room during the holidays i wouldnt stay again and i would suggest others look elsewhere when in the area there are many great hotels in sf its perhaps one of the most competitive hotel markets in any city ive traveled to and in dont sell yourself short make sure you select a hotel that really fits what you are looking for in regards to location comfort cleanliness friendliness price and room parameters its possible that this hotel will meet your needs but dont be fooled by all of the positive praise it has received it was just okay,tripadvisor,fan kimpton group stayed kimptons sf across u wanted give argonaut try since looked visually appealing

952,this property had great views and outstanding service nice touch to give a 10 credit for the restaurant splurge and get room with view of golden gate its well worth it they made it easy to add on wine for our arrival and even had a souvenir for purchase in the room my son loved his argonaut sea otter,the argonauts unique looks its bold almost cartoonish maritime theme and easy walker location lured me in for a 2 day solo stay while visiting old friends in sf my stay followed a trip with my husband to wine country so i was still basking in memory of other upscale hotels when i arrived at the argonaut in that light the argonaut selling itself as a luxury hotel at luxury hotel prices was a definite disappointment here is what i did and didnt like about this hotel the good 1 walking location if the crowds drive you mad turn away from fishermans wharf craziness and go left you can take a wonderful walk to the pier up into the marina and as far as you like towards golden gate bridge beautiful 2 fun theming i rather liked the brash decor and im sure it is thrilling for kids visiting with family although that giant boat wheel mirror directly facing the bed was a bit much particularly for a solitary traveler 3 housekeeping hotel and room were very clean when i left requests for certain items a replacement for the broken pen and a robe since one was missing they were delivered and staged nicely the bad 1 price i paid almost 1000 for 2 nights in a room that did not have a luxury setting or approach see below for more details my king deluxe was comfortable but rather shotgun in its narrowness and my only view was of a courtyard where folks drank talked and occasionally howled at the moon really all day and night i have paid far less for much better spaces in similarly desirable locations often a luxury hotel will make up a less than perfect room for you with extra benefits and service but that did not happen here 2 seals minibars and itty bitty bottles of booze show me a luxury hotel where you have to ask for a robe to be delivered how about a room with a small cute madeinchinafor15cents plush seal with argonaut stitched on the side left prominently on the bed and on closer examination with a price tag of 22 the mini bar list said only 14 what a bargain a large minibar that looked like the food concessions at a movie theater minus the helpful glass barrier was just as expensive i couldnt help but wonder how quickly the tab would ring up when a small child entered and grabbed the cute seal giant pack of mms cranberry banana chips etc i didnt have to wonder what an adult would think of the 26 bottles of bad wine i still had a free bottle one of two of good wine our cheaper healdsburg hotel had given us as a courtesy the night before just to be clear ive seen such seals and minibars before at other hotelsmotels but at a true luxury hotel this price point the seal is free to take home to your kid and so are the snacks if not the alcohol management really needs to think this one through set up a snack shack in the lobby if you need too but dont turn my room into a luxury tourista minimart 3 front desk service after exploring muir woods earlier in the day i arrived at checkin in clean jeans a tshirt and black anorak definitely not a street urchin but not direct from tiffanys either the clients in front of me were dressed in business attire and receiving prompt attentive service on my turn the blonde front desk lady looked me over gave me a one minute finger signal and spent 45 minutes answering the phone talking to a coworker and casting glances perhaps to see if the other agent or the totally unoccupied also watching concierge had welcomed andor taken me yet when that failed she handed me over to a new relatively untrained staffer without a further word perhaps if i had been dressed more nicely i would have gotten faster friendlier service or perhaps not either way this does not speak well for service first impressions or the hotel 4 not a driving location i mentioned walking as a benefit driving is much less so when one of my friends tried to pick me up from the hotel it was nigh impossible for her to get there and the parking rates when she did were extraordinary there are so many amazing things to do and see in san francisco frankly this hotel is a much pricer attraction than it is currently worth if you can get a room with a view guarantee maybe it would be better but make sure to tell them to hide the seal and candy bars from your kid first,tripadvisor,argonaut unique look bold almost

955,san fransisco is best experienced at fishermans wharf right next to historic cable cars is the equally historic unique and beautiful argonaut hotel the front desk and concierge are world class with amazing insight to activities and restaurants in the bay area and beyond staff are incredibly sincere and helpful they upgraded my room free of charge gave us free gifts to celebrate our engagement and even assisted in coordinating parts of it i would not stay anywhere else,i stayed in the argonaut several times last year and most recently beginning of february 2019 san francisco is a difficult place to find good hotels eg if you compare to nyc or european hotels and in regards to the location size of rooms the argonaut is certainly one of the better ones considering the price unfortunately the service is poor although a returning customer the would not recognize me would ask to do all the paper work again and again if you come back to the hotel in the evenings you will find rubbish from roomservice in the halls and it will not change until the morning also security is not up to date located in a very busy tourist location you see many non residents entering the hotel during the day they can go up to the rooms as they is no security on elevators or video surveillance in the halls feels sometimes a bit scary,tripadvisor,stayed argonaut several time last year recently beginning february san francisco difficult place find good hotel eg compare nyc european hotel regard location size argonaut certainly one better one considering price unfortunately service poor although returning customer would recognize would ask paper work come back evening find rubbish roomservice hall change morning also security date located busy tourist location see many non resident entering day go security elevator video surveillance hall feel sometimes bit scary,Neutral,Friendly Staff & Exceptional Service

958,i am a fan of the kimpton hotel group and have stayed at other kimptons in sf and across the us i wanted to give the argonaut a try since the rooms looked visually appealing and the reviews were on par with my experiences at other kimptons overall i would actually say that our stay was disappointing for several reasons most on the part of the argonaut the rest on myself disappointing aspects in no specific order the staff i felt it was rather nonexistent aside from the gentlemen working the front door checkin was fine but not overly welcoming this was unusual for a kimpton checkout well even though we stood in line we waited longer since a person just sauntered up to ask questions and the the guest relations representative allowed this to happen my usually experience at a kimpton is you are often greeted warmly throughout your stay and there is a large staff presence in the hotel any other kimpton i have stayed at i would constantly see and be greeted by staff members at all hours of the day this was not the case here the wine hour was packed and seemed to be filled with people who knew about it but were actually not staying at the hotel in fact i often saw people walking away from the hotel with wine glasses this seems like a real liability issue i am not even sure there are people managing the wine hour there was no complimentary or tea or coffee service as you would find at other kimptons in the morning sure there was a coffee maker in the room but in the bathroom and that was uncomfortable at best they probably didnt want to deal with another round of people coming in for the free items logical but not really a kimpton experience the rooms the rooms are visually appealing and spacious but the beds were so hard that we barely slept in hindsight we wish we would have check out and tried another hotel because all of us 3 stayed in one room found we were in pain a week after traveling this is something another guest noted the beds in the double rooms are way too hard i actually prefer a firmer bed but these beds were so hard that one of us actually decided to try sleeping in the arm chair in the room they were that uncomfortable i cant convey how much this impacted our stay and the days after our stay i really felt awful and i am very sorry that i didnt saying anything about it at the time because i paid financially physically and mentally for it cleanliness the room was mostly clean but there were a lot of inconsistencies in the cleaning from day one to day two and three i also found it frustrating that the carpets were not vacuumed daily this seems like basic room service to me i felt there was a disconnect in this area that could be easily managed we left tips daily which were taken but the items we specifically requested more towels floor vacuumed were not provided the restaurant is terrible dont go there are much better places to eat in sf and i highly recommend that you by bypass it at all cost our breakfast was terrible the service was careless and lackadaisical our server actually told us he spaced out while taking our order the food was served cold without any condiments and it was expensive for what you get skip it the location this is my fault i wanted to try something different and get out of downtown but i felt this location was too much on the fringe of everything sure it was within walking distance to many things but they were not things i am that interested in if you want to stay on the wharf note that this is on the fringe of it not the heart of it if you dont want to be in a touristy location with the ding ding ding of the trolley nearby and the hoots and shouts of the duck boats then stay away from this location at all costs it will make you mad while not a big deal the hotel is also fully of families at all hours children were running up and down the halls there are also only two elevators and you often had to wait a short wait not a big deal to get to your room at all hours after thinking about it after the fact i would stay this stay was rather poor if i had to do it all over again i would really consider bringing it up the the management but i checked in on christmas day and i heard them tell someone inquiring about a room that they only had two left i knew it would be fruitless to complain about the beds when there was clearly no comparable room we could be moved to when we left the doorman asked us how our stay was and we mentioned the how terrible the beds were and his response was everyone says that its been a real problem and management is looking into it this actually made everything worse really you know this is a problem but youre just looking into it the really frustrating aspect is that its very hard to find many rooms in the sf area with two queen beds most of the rooms offer only two full beds while this is find for two people its challenging for three adults this was the main reason we selected this hotel because it was important for all of us to be together in the same room during the holidays i wouldnt stay again and i would suggest others look elsewhere when in the area there are many great hotels in sf its perhaps one of the most competitive hotel markets in any city ive traveled to and in dont sell yourself short make sure you select a hotel that really fits what you are looking for in regards to location comfort cleanliness friendliness price and room parameters its possible that this hotel will meet your needs but dont be fooled by all of the positive praise it has received it was just okay,the argonaut will always have a spot in my heart its not a chain its a friendly local hotel that ahs the vibe of warmth and welcome that i seek i dont want a huge hotel where i am just a number and the argonaut is definitively a quality hotel the location is the best in the wharf staff are awesome food is great and well i always return there,tripadvisor,argonaut always spot heart chain friendly local ahs vibe warmth welcome seek dont want huge number argonaut definitively quality location best wharf staff awesome food great well always return,Positive,Friendly Staff & Exceptional Service
959,great location if you like the wharf area and we had a suite was very nice lots of room very well decorated and modern lessons learned however when we checked in we had a bay view room had an early check in which was great but there was a street musician playing right outside our room which was loud and we all agree needed to move us hotel did so promptly the problem began that night with the people above us for almost two hour straight there was a continuous thumping or stomping noise i called the front desk and they indicated they would contact them next morning at 730 it began again this went on for two more nights and two mornings i probably called the front desk 6 more times and they continued to apologize and try to get the people to stop i also thought the person above us was checking out sooner lessons learned we probably should have moved the first day secondly i would have liked the hotel to have been more aggressive in some way with the people above and lastly people who are that inconsiderate to other people in hotels should learn that we are all sharing some space here and to be more considerate of others the hotel did offer a small compensation which i really didnt care because it was more important to us to enjoy the very nice suite we had reserved 6 months ago anyway just words of advice if you have issues get them resolved immediately and to what you want,we stayed in this splendid hotel located in the fishermans wharf area for 3 nights by booking two double rooms and we had a very good time the staff is very professional and kind the red brick building which was historically a delmonte warehouse is truly charming and furnished in a nautical style the excellent location a few minutes walk from pier 39 but in the quietest and most decorous area service impeccable laundry and at normal prices expensive parking 65+tax and valet parking however all the car parks in the area are expensive around 50 a day but where you risk finding your car windows broken by thieves san francisco has become dangerous worth the money they ask for and i would stay here again,tripadvisor,stayed splendid located fisherman wharf area night booking two double good time staff professional kind red brick building historically delmonte warehouse truly charming furnished nautical style excellent location minute walk pier quietest decorous area service impeccable laundry normal price expensive parking tax valet parking however car park area expensive around day risk finding car window broken thief san francisco become dangerous worth money ask would,Positive,Parking & Service Concerns

975,the argonauts unique looks its bold almost cartoonish maritime theme and easy walker location lured me in for a 2 day solo stay while visiting old friends in sf my stay followed a trip with my husband to wine country so i was still basking in memory of other upscale hotels when i arrived at the argonaut in that light the argonaut selling itself as a luxury hotel at luxury hotel prices was a definite disappointment here is what i did and didnt like about this hotel the good 1 walking location if the crowds drive you mad turn away from fishermans wharf craziness and go left you can take a wonderful walk to the pier up into the marina and as far as you like towards golden gate bridge beautiful 2 fun theming i rather liked the brash decor and im sure it is thrilling for kids visiting with family although that giant boat wheel mirror directly facing the bed was a bit much particularly for a solitary traveler 3 housekeeping hotel and room were very clean when i left requests for certain items a replacement for the broken pen and a robe since one was missing they were delivered and staged nicely the bad 1 price i paid almost 1000 for 2 nights in a room that did not have a luxury setting or approach see below for more details my king deluxe was comfortable but rather shotgun in its narrowness and my only view was of a courtyard where folks drank talked and occasionally howled at the moon really all day and night i have paid far less for much better spaces in similarly desirable locations often a luxury hotel will make up a less than perfect room for you with extra benefits and service but that did not happen here 2 seals minibars and itty bitty bottles of booze show me a luxury hotel where you have to ask for a robe to be delivered how about a room with a small cute madeinchinafor15cents plush seal with argonaut stitched on the side left prominently on the bed and on closer examination with a price tag of 22 the mini bar list said only 14 what a bargain a large minibar that looked like the food concessions at a movie theater minus the helpful glass barrier was just as expensive i couldnt help but wonder how quickly the tab would ring up when a small child entered and grabbed the cute seal giant pack of mms cranberry banana chips etc i didnt have to wonder what an adult would think of the 26 bottles of bad wine i still had a free bottle one of two of good wine our cheaper healdsburg hotel had given us as a courtesy the night before just to be clear ive seen such seals and minibars before at other hotelsmotels but at a true luxury hotel this price point the seal is free to take home to your kid and so are the snacks if not the alcohol management really needs to think this one through set up a snack shack in the lobby if you need too but dont turn my room into a luxury tourista minimart 3 front desk service after exploring muir woods earlier in the day i arrived at checkin in clean jeans a tshirt and black anorak definitely not a street urchin but not direct from tiffanys either the clients in front of me were dressed in business attire and receiving prompt attentive service on my turn the blonde front desk lady looked me over gave me a one minute finger signal and spent 45 minutes answering the phone talking to a coworker and casting glances perhaps to see if the other agent or the totally unoccupied also watching concierge had welcomed andor taken me yet when that failed she handed me over to a new relatively untrained staffer without a further word perhaps if i had been dressed more nicely i would have gotten faster friendlier service or perhaps not either way this does not speak well for service first impressions or the hotel 4 not a driving location i mentioned walking as a benefit driving is much less so when one of my friends tried to pick me up from the hotel it was nigh impossible for her to get there and the parking rates when she did were extraordinary there are so many amazing things to do and see in san francisco frankly this hotel is a much pricer attraction than it is currently worth if you can get a room with a view guarantee maybe it would be better but make sure to tell them to hide the seal and candy bars from your kid first,me and my partner staying in this hotel in san francisco as part of a trip to america we was amazing with the size of the whole place rooms were massive very happy with the location walking distance to everywhere would recommend this place to anybody has everything in a hotel you are looking for with excellent customer service,tripadvisor,partner staying san francisco part trip america amazing size whole place massive happy location walking distance everywhere would recommend place anybody everything looking excellent customer service,Positive,Friendly Staff & Exceptional Service

978,i stayed in the argonaut several times last year and most recently beginning of february 2019 san francisco is a difficult place to find good hotels eg if you compare to nyc or european hotels and in regards to the location size of rooms the argonaut is certainly one of the better ones considering the price unfortunately the service is poor although a returning customer the would not recognize me would ask to do all the paper work again and again if you come back to the hotel in the evenings you will find rubbish from roomservice in the halls and it will not change until the morning also security is not up to date located in a very busy tourist location you see many non residents entering the hotel during the day they can go up to the rooms as they is no security on elevators or video surveillance in the halls feels sometimes a bit scary,i would give this hotel three and a half stars but i am giving them 4 for the benefit of the doubt it is simply too expensive for what you get we booked two connecting rooms one a suite and the other to my recollection i was told a suite facing the water that is why we selected this hotel when we arrived the record showed differently and both of our suite and room were facing the street the building is old and the windows small although i know the management can do little about that another big surprise upon arrival was that the concierge worked remotely most of the time that was our first visit to san francisco and although the concierge responded to our calls quickly it would have been easier if she was live sometimes only one person was at the front and we could not ask lengthy questions and have others waiting in line behind us several positive things about this hotel one main item is the excellent location it is close to all the tourist areas they had a very nice staff and they tried to be helpful the surroundings were very quiet even though we were very close to all the action the beds were very comfortable they had a very nice restaurant attached to the hotel,tripadvisor,would give three half star giving benefit doubt simply expensive get booked two connecting one suite recollection told suite facing water selected arrived record showed differently suite facing street building old window small although know management little another big surprise upon arrival concierge worked remotely time first visit san francisco although concierge responded call quickly would easier live sometimes one person front could ask lengthy question others waiting line behind u several positive thing one main item excellent location close tourist area nice staff tried helpful surroundings quiet even though close action bed comfortable nice restaurant attached,Positive,Friendly Staff & Exceptional Service

980,a very contemporary yet nostalgic nauticalstyle hotel in a prime location in fishermans wharf near ghirardelli square the argonaut hotel is in a beautiful red brick building which looks like an old wharf warehouse this was our first stop on our coviddelayed honeymoon and it was a lovely hotel to start it off we were originally meant to be staying around union square but the quieter fishermans wharf location was perfect for us the initial impression was good the open fire in the lobby was inviting for such cool weather and receptionists and bell men were friendly and attentive we were upgraded to a room with 2 double beds the room was very spacious and had a great walkin closet i loved the plantation shutters and exposed beams and brickwork very classic in style the hotel acknowledged our honeymoon with a lovely card and bottle of californian red wine thank you so much we stayed here for 3 nights and it was a great stay the only sour note is that since leaving the hotel on 20th may our 300 incidentals charge still hasnt returned to my credit card it is showing as pending almost 4 weeks later the hotel has informed me that the hold had been lifted at checkout and that it was a likely problem with my bank we stayed at 5 hotels on this usa trip using the same card and this is the only one where weve encountered this problem this otherwise wouldve been a 5star review,first of all the location was more than we hoped for hotel is located 15 min walk from the pier 39 and 3 min walk from both cable car turnaround and ghirardelli square there are plenty of restaurants and pubs near the hotel so it was good to relax and enjoy at the same time the hotel also allowed us to keep our luggage 4 days prior to check in which made our road trip easier the room is well furnished and i loved the bay view it could be a bit noisy during the weekend afternoon but i thoguht that was also the part of the touristy atmosphere,tripadvisor,first location hoped located min walk pier min walk cable car turnaround ghirardelli square plenty restaurant pub near good relax enjoy time also allowed u keep luggage day prior check made road trip easier well furnished loved bay view could bit noisy weekend afternoon thoguht also part touristy atmosphere,Positive,Excellent Location & Nearby Attractions

999,firstly i want to thank the reviewers who wrote about argonaut as they were quite spot on the location is perfect its not as noisy as you would expect it to be as it is further up north from pier39 and most of the hustle and bustle of fishermans wharf make sure you dont miss the powell hyde turnaround right by the side before you reach ghiradelli square the maritime national historical park is a great place to walk about make sure you visit the maritime museum and the hyde street pier i was a little bit disappointed not all the exhibit areas of the museum was open i think it was maintenance work walk out on the municipal pier for a view of the sf golden gate bridge as for the hotel the staff are very friendly and very helpful we had to pay extra 50bucks to check in earlier than 3pm but we were upgraded to a bigger room so no complaints there the bathtub faucet diverter was really tight and difficult to use but the service was excellent the guy came almost immediately after we reported it note that because of the pandemic you do need to inform them if you want the room serviced otherwise you can ask for fresh towels and more coffee any time bring your own tea satchets though if you want a cuppa we tried asking but they didnt supply that if you have kids just be aware the cute soft toy on the bed is not a freebie the rooms are clean check out the mini museum just straight on from the reception its so cool to be in an historical building the nautical theme interior design is in line with the location maritime national historical park and when you head out for the day the staff was so kind they offered us bottled water if you need them back to location its close to the muni f line if the cable car proves a tad pricey with the muni mobile app you can buy a day pass for the cable car and ride them all for the experience its fun otherwise walking around this area is delightful,an absolutely well led and beautiful hotel with an extraordinary good breakfast restaurant the barista and his capuccino just a blast friendly staff allover the closeness to pier 41 and 39 and specially to the turning point of the cable car makes the hotel an ideal one to explore and enjoy san francisco we will come back,tripadvisor,absolutely well led beautiful extraordinary good breakfast restaurant barista capuccino blast friendly staff allover closeness pier specially turning point cable car make ideal one explore enjoy san francisco come back,Positive,Excellent Location & Nearby Attractions

1001,i would give this hotel three and a half stars but i am giving them 4 for the benefit of the doubt it is simply too expensive for what you get we booked two connecting rooms one a suite and the other to my recollection i was told a suite facing the water that is why we selected this hotel when we arrived the record showed differently and both of our suite and room were facing the street the building is old and the windows small although i know the management can do little about that another big surprise upon arrival was that the concierge worked remotely most of the time that was our first visit to san francisco and although the concierge responded to our calls quickly it would have been easier if she was live sometimes only one person was at the front and we could not ask lengthy questions and have others waiting in line behind us several positive things about this hotel one main item is the excellent location it is close to all the tourist areas they had a very nice staff and they tried to be helpful the surroundings were very quiet even though we were very close to all the action the beds were very comfortable they had a very nice restaurant attached to the hotel,we took our 2 boys to san francisco for spring break and stayed here for 5 nights first of all the location could not be better we had a view of the golden gate bridge from our window and a view of the cable cars getting ready for the day everything you want to do is walking distance or a short uber ride in the lobby there is a maritime museum run by the national parks service that is really well done and my boys earned a park service badge there is also a beach across the street that we could walk on if you are doing a family trip to san francisco this is the place food was excellent at the blue mermaid too,tripadvisor,took boy san francisco spring break stayed night first location could better view golden gate bridge window view cable car getting ready day everything want walking distance short uber ride lobby maritime museum run national park service really well done boy earned park service badge also beach across street could walk family trip san francisco place food excellent blue mermaid,Positive,Scenic Views & Hotel Aesthetic

1003,first of all the location was more than we hoped for hotel is located 15 min walk from the pier 39 and 3 min walk from both cable car turnaround and ghirardelli square there are plenty of restaurants and pubs near the hotel so it was good to relax and enjoy at the same time the hotel also allowed us to keep our luggage 4 days prior to check in which made our road trip easier the room is well furnished and i loved the bay view it could be a bit noisy during the weekend afternoon but i thoguht that was also the part of the touristy atmosphere,i was aware of the daily 25 resort fee but please tell me how the word resort applies upon arrival at our floor there were 2 trays of half eaten meals on the floor and 2 additional empty cocktail glasses at the foot of my room and there they remained for the next 2 days getting a single additional bar of soap proved quite the challenge with your staffregardless of asking no extra soap bar to be found in our bathroom and so we remained one little square of soap for my wife and i for our 6 night stayby day 3 i bought my own i enjoy music as much as anyone but i dont care to hear that disco beat pounding through the lobby and on the elevators at 56 am why 5am because thats the time i left my room every morning to walk to a local starbucks to get coffee 10 for your pot of 2 small cups did i mention the 25 daily resort fee oh that must mean the restaurant area deck chairs against the back wall adjacent to the restrooms shower curtains must be expensive to replace as evidenced by the mold along the bottom of mine there is some good to be said excellent locationyour desk staff is quite nice and friendlyyour blue mermaid restaurant staff were extremely pleasant and attentive and i was more than happy to leave them generous tips its the little thingsget your stuff together,tripadvisor,aware daily resort fee please tell word resort applies upon arrival floor tray half eaten meal floor additional empty cocktail glass foot remained next day getting single additional bar soap proved quite challenge staffregardless asking extra soap bar found bathroom remained one little square soap wife night stayby day bought enjoy music much anyone dont care hear disco beat pounding lobby elevator thats time left every morning walk local starbucks get coffee pot small cup mention daily resort fee oh must mean restaurant area deck chair back wall adjacent restroom shower curtain must expensive replace evidenced mold along bottom mine good said excellent locationyour desk staff quite nice friendlyyour blue mermaid restaurant staff extremely pleasant attentive happy leave generous tip little thingsget stuff together,Positive,Friendly Staff & Exceptional Service

1006,pretty disappointing stay particularly because the was almost empty due to fears over the coronavirus when we arrived we were assigned by a disinterested employee arguably the worst room in the hotel second floor interior dark view of roofing etc after specifically requesting an upper floor and bay view my guess is that the room assignment may have been because we were able to secure an excellent rate due to march visit and low occupancy not sure why our request was completely ignored television was glitchy turning off at will and when we request a late checkout we were told check out is noon no exceptions regardless of occupancy etc have stayed at this property in the past and enjoyed it very much as its location is perfect for exploring the fishermans wharf area access to cable cars ghirardelli square etc not this time particularly at this price point even with a great deal we still paid 25000 per night we had a choice between the fairmont and the argonaut hotel both at the same price point at this point in time we made a mistake its not the cool class hotel weve frequented in the past very dissatisfied and disappointing,lovely hotel with no surprises compared to their website friendly staff all round and comfortable rustic rooms close to all the good stuff our only complaint was that the rooms did suffer quite a bit from external noise cars party goers etc but all part of the atmosphere of the area i guess,tripadvisor,lovely surprise compared website friendly staff round comfortable rustic close good stuff complaint suffer quite bit external noise car party goer etc part atmosphere area guess,Positive,Friendly Staff & Exceptional Service

1043,the location of this hotel is a+ and a very classy place to stay easy walk to lots of attractions in san francisco the hotel room was a good size and comfortable very cute ocean themed room including octopus wallpaper in the bathroom which i would love in my home the only downsides were that i wish there was more staffguest interaction which would make it feel more welcoming the shower wasnt very hot and reception took quite a large deposit upon check in more than the total amount of my accommodation and it took 2 weeks to clear which hurt my credit card for future hotel deposits however these werent huge issues and i would 100 return on my next trip,my husband and i have been to sf many times but have never stayed on the wharf we chose this hotel from expedia and were not disappointed the location is great for all sf has to offer the hotel door is right next to ben and jerrys and the waffle cone smell greeted us each morning the hotel is very clean the beds comfy and the decor wowed me every detail was thought outthe chandeliers in the lobby the colors the chairs the fixturesloved it our room was nice and quiet and we had room service twice which was yummy check out the adjoining wine bar,tripadvisor,husband sf many time never stayed wharf chose expedia disappointed location great sf offer door right next ben jerry waffle cone smell greeted u morning clean bed comfy decor wowed every detail thought outthe chandelier lobby color chair fixturesloved nice quiet service twice yummy check adjoining wine bar,Positive,Excellent Location & Nearby Attractions

1113,we had a wonderful rime staying at the argonaut so much was within walking distance and if we needed a cab the doorman jason put us in the hands of a truly awesome cab driver the rooms are clean the restaurant has really good food and the wait staff were very friendly and accomodating i will recommend your hotel to anyone i know that plans to visit san fran thank you again,i stayed here for 5 nights to celebrate my 30th birthday it cost us around 1300 the hotel is spotlessly clean and really nicely decorated our room had a view of the golden gate bridge and upon arrival a note to wish me a happy birthday and a bottle of wine were in the roomive no idea how the hotel knew it was my birthday my boyfriend is adamant he didnt mention it so i can only assume this is how much attention to detail is given for booking that they noticed the date all the staff we came across throughout the stay were really friendly and went out of the way to ensure our stay was perfect the wine hour is great the free bicycle hire would have been fantastic if i could ride a bike however after borrowing one from the hotel it became evident very quickly that i lost that ability somewhere in the last 15 years haha the restaurant in the hotel is lovely but there are some really great ones in the courtyard next door too especially the mexican which was excellent the location is perfect easy to get a cab close to sightseeing buses cable car turn table and a short walk to pier 39 easy to walk to the alcatraz landing from here too room was warm and cosy bathrobes were super cute and all the staff we came across were super friendly the only negative point i have about the hotel is that our room whilst lovely was tiny perhaps it was because we had just arrived there after a week in caesars palace lv but im pretty sure we must have had one of the smallest rooms in the hotel it wasnt a problem as we didnt spend long in the room anyway but if you arent planning on exploring and want to stay in the room i would recommend upgrading to a larger room,tripadvisor,stayed night celebrate th birthday cost u around spotlessly clean really nicely decorated view golden gate bridge upon arrival note wish happy birthday bottle wine roomive idea knew birthday boyfriend adamant didnt mention assume much attention detail given booking noticed date staff came across throughout really friendly went way ensure perfect wine hour great free bicycle hire would fantastic could ride bike however borrowing one became evident quickly lost ability somewhere last year haha restaurant lovely really great one courtyard next door especially mexican excellent location perfect easy get cab close sightseeing bus cable car turn table short walk pier easy walk alcatraz landing warm cosy bathrobe super cute staff came across super friendly negative point whilst lovely tiny perhaps arrived week caesar palace lv im pretty sure must one smallest wasnt problem didnt spend long anyway arent planning exploring want would recommend upgrading larger,Positive,Friendly Staff & Exceptional Service
1114,this is a great hotel in a historic building with lots of character retained from its previous life as a fruit packing warehouse the spacious and long rooms are tastefully done to maintain the character with exposed brick and beams with a nautical twist the hotel building is recessed into a steep hill so if you are in a room at the back of the hotel on the third floor it will still seem like you are almost on ground level so for a higher view ask to be closer to the front of the hotel we were about half way back on the third floor and when looking out of our window it seemed we were almost street level we did have a view of the park and the golden gate bridge in the distance the room had lovely toiletries and bathrobes and a very comfortable bed the wine tasting next to the hotel is worth a visit we had 5 different tasters for 15 with a sparkling and an extra glass thrown in for free the blue mermaid bar and restaurant connected to the hotel is also very good nice dcor and the award winning crab chowder was delicious the free bikes offered by the hotel were all gone by the time we tried to get them which was fine as we walked over the bridge but if this is something you want to do then book early my only negative is just thats its really expensive for a 4 star hotel i suppose it is a lovely hotel right in the tourist area and we were staying over a weekend but our bill for 3 nights without breakfast was nearly 1800ouch it was more expensive than our 5 star apartment room in vegas so although i loved this hotel the price wasnt really justified and i would only stay again if i could get a cheaper deal,first off its a great boutique hotel fairly large with a pretty cool nautical theme the bar at the restaurant downstairs was cool as well everyone was helpful it was clean and upkept very well best part however was the location it is literally across the street from the maritime museum and about a block from fishermans wharf everything youd like to see in a long weekend is in walking distance ie no rental car needed i was at a conference so i didnt have all of the free time in the world but id definitely stay there again for pleasure,tripadvisor,first great boutique fairly large pretty cool nautical theme bar restaurant downstairs cool well everyone helpful clean upkept well best part however location literally across street maritime museum block fisherman wharf everything youd like see long weekend walking distance ie rental car needed conference didnt free time world id definitely pleasure,Positive,Excellent Location & Nearby Attractions

1133,stayed here on our last night of our road trip in the us on great ta reviews and i can only agree actually i think it could be the best us hotel i have stayed in not cheap and i agree that breakfast could have been included although that is unusual anywhere these days but i have paid this for a matchbox in london with second hand furniture all the staff were super friendly not just american false if you know what i mean and we were upgraded to a room with a great view of the harbour but still quiet tasteful seaside theme and superfast wifi my only problem was that we only had one night here and had spent many in below par hotels on our trip i wouldnt hesitate to stay here again when in san francisco,lovely hotel right on fishermans wharf quiet luxury hotel with great bar restaurant the wharf is definitely aimed at tourists so youll pay more but if you want to spend time on the wharf access the various piers close to cable car stops and hop on tour buses this hotel is great,tripadvisor,lovely right fisherman wharf quiet luxury great bar restaurant wharf definitely aimed tourist youll pay want spend time wharf access various pier close cable car stop hop tour bus great,Positive,Excellent Location & Nearby Attractions

1136,i stayed here for 5 nights to celebrate my 30th birthday it cost us around 1300 the hotel is spotlessly clean and really nicely decorated our room had a view of the golden gate bridge and upon arrival a note to wish me a happy birthday and a bottle of wine were in the roomive no idea how the hotel knew it was my birthday my boyfriend is adamant he didnt mention it so i can only assume this is how much attention to detail is given for booking that they noticed the date all the staff we came across throughout the stay were really friendly and went out of the way to ensure our stay was perfect the wine hour is great the free bicycle hire would have been fantastic if i could ride a bike however after borrowing one from the hotel it became evident very quickly that i lost that ability somewhere in the last 15 years haha the restaurant in the hotel is lovely but there are some really great ones in the courtyard next door too especially the mexican which was excellent the location is perfect easy to get a cab close to sightseeing buses cable car turn table and a short walk to pier 39 easy to walk to the alcatraz landing from here too room was warm and cosy bathrobes were super cute and all the staff we came across were super friendly the only negative point i have about the hotel is that our room whilst lovely was tiny perhaps it was because we had just arrived there after a week in caesars palace lv but im pretty sure we must have had one of the smallest rooms in the hotel it wasnt a problem as we didnt spend long in the room anyway but if you arent planning on exploring and want to stay in the room i would recommend upgrading to a larger room,excellent location super helpful and friendly staff easy walking to golden gate bridge pier 39 and beyond bedroom and bed very comfy no tea just coffee provided interior view means everyone elses shutters but theyre all white wooden ones so look good blue mermaid restaurant does delicious breakfast but a little pricey we paid 62 for the 2 of us however they are big portions and lots of great coffee refills really enjoyed our 2 might stay an route to new zealand from the uk,tripadvisor,excellent location super helpful friendly staff easy walking golden gate bridge pier beyond bedroom bed comfy tea coffee provided interior view mean everyone elses shutter theyre white wooden one look good blue mermaid restaurant delicious breakfast little pricey paid u however big portion lot great coffee refill really enjoyed might route new zealand uk,Positive,Friendly Staff & Exceptional Service
1137,first off its a great boutique hotel fairly large with a pretty cool nautical theme the bar at the restaurant downstairs was cool as well everyone was helpful it was clean and upkept very well best part however was the location it is literally across the street from the maritime museum and about a block from fishermans wharf everything youd like to see in a long weekend is in walking distance ie no rental car needed i was at a conference so i didnt have all of the free time in the world but id definitely stay there again for pleasure,i stayed here with my mum back in march for my birthday as a short getaway from the moment we checked in the hotel team were friendly and very welcoming the hotel has a very unique looking design which fits in with its location in fishermans wharf the location is great for going out sight seeing and very close to public transport including the old style trams i cant compliment the hotel team enough they knew it was my birthday and laid out a few surprises which were lovely,tripadvisor,stayed mum back march birthday short getaway moment checked team friendly welcoming unique looking design fit location fisherman wharf location great going sight seeing close public transport including old style tram cant compliment team enough knew birthday laid surprise lovely,Positive,Excellent Location & Nearby Attractions
1138,clean warm and comfortable but a long walk from reception to our room friendly staff but once again no free wifi no breakfast included or else they forgot to mention it and the most annoying they even charged for the bottled water in the room certainly americans like to milk every penny they can from tourists but that was pure meanness,the argonaut is in a great location it is slightly away from the main touristy area of pier 39 but still not too far away the building itself is beautiful and the nautical theme is nice the staff are all extremely professional and helpful from reception the door people and the cleaning people a warm hello from the cleaning people is always a great touch also the room was as expected of a high standard and most of all the bed was comfortable gone are the days when i can sleep on any kind of bed and my back appreciated the firmness of the mattress it wasnt too firm it was just perfect we had breakfast at the hotel which was very nice but for a more all singing all dancing kind of a breakfast id recommend the hollywood cafe on north point street we went on quite a few tours during our time in san francisco our favourites were out to visit the coastal redwoods at muir woods and of course alcatraz island dont forget the 5 all day vintage street car pass,tripadvisor,argonaut great location slightly away main touristy area pier still far away building beautiful nautical theme nice staff extremely professional helpful reception door people cleaning people warm hello cleaning people always great touch also expected high standard bed comfortable gone day sleep kind bed back appreciated firmness mattress wasnt firm perfect breakfast nice singing dancing kind breakfast id recommend hollywood cafe north point street went quite tour time san francisco favourite visit coastal redwood muir wood course alcatraz island dont forget day vintage street car pas,Positive,Friendly Staff & Exceptional Service
